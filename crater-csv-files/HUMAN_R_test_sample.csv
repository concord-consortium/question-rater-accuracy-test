"Lowering human emissions by 50% reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide and the global temperature. While the temperature did lower to the baseline of 0, it also started to go below 0. The model shows that when the carbon dioxide went down, the temperature also went down, gradually.",3
The more co2 that is in the atmosphere the temperature rises so by decreasing the amount of co2 emissions,3
I used the scale to raise the percent to 25 and the temperature didn't increase but when raised it up to 75% it started increasing.,3

The model showed what the temperature would be like if we bring emisssions ,2
I am pretty confident in this answeer I used what I learned in the other slides before this one and I used what I learned in this slide as well so therefore I am pretty confident that I got this answer right,1
"The models and graphs influenced my certainty on my explanation. No human emissions means way colder temperature than average because, the human emission trap the earths heat in and if there is no emissions then nothings going to retain the heat in and the earths temperatures are going to be cooler.",3

The amount of total Carbon Dioxide in the air will contribute to the overall global temperature and either make it increase a lot or decease a lot and when you put the Human Emissions all the way to 200% the Carbon Dioxide is coming out twice as fast causing the air to be more filled with Carbon Dioxide which would change the overall temperature. ,3

im not really sure on how to  answer this question ,1
The model above shows how human emissions change the temperature and the things in the atmosphere. Humans give off so much emissions that even half of what we emit still causes a rise in the global temperatures as shown in the graph above. only when there are no emissions to speak of in the model does the temperature start to fall.,2

The ice melts the warmer the water gets and the warmer the world gets.,2
The ice melts the warmer the water gets and the warmer the world gets. With the temperature getting warmer the more global temperature will build.,2
im a little certain with answer because shown in the diagram above when you raise the level of human emission the ice starts to melt. when you drop the emission there is more ice in the diagram.,3

When the emission gets very high all of the heat is spread out around the area which cause the temperature to rise. When you set the emission low there isn't enough heat to support the earth,3

"The graph is pretty inconsistent, but overall the temperature elowered when I lowered the emissions to these levels. ",3
"The upper graph gradually went up in temperature when I moved the emissions down by 50%. Therefore, the total amount of emissions needs to greatly decrease. ",3

I am confident that the ice continuing to melt would make the iptemperature to increase because there is less light that will be reflected ,2
According to the graph the CO2 in the ocean is going up and down whenever the water vapor increases or decreases,3
"I am very certain about my answer because of the evidence shown in the model and graphs. The model showed changes in water vapor, carbon dioxide, clouds, and sea ice. This showed that the less carbon dioxide present, the less clouds and water vapor, while sea ice increased. The graph showed the temperature increases and decreases that concurred with all of these changes.",3

"I am certain about my answer because when human emissions increase, the warmer it gets. I know this because the graph is showing that the earth's temperature is increasing when I add around 50-75% more emissions.

I am only basing my information off of the model on which the temperature changed drastically whether I increased the human emissions by 200 percent or took them away completely. The information of the graph does not show other factors so I only used factors from the model ,3
"I am very certain because In the graph you can see that as you increase human emissions, temperature begins to increase which increases evaporation and decreases the amount of co2 in the ocean. You can see in the model the ice melt as temperature increases. According to my prior knowledge I know that co2 and temperature are directly linked. this is why I am certain.",3
"I am certain my answer is correct and logical because first experiment I tried which was 75% emissions with the model resulted in little to no change in the graphs. So I decreased the emissions further to fifty percent. Here is where I saw a change. After fifty percent was reached on the model, the graphs changed and after increasing in temperature, they decreased noticeably. Thus 50% emission rate is probably the ideal. ",3
If you changed the model down 25% then on the graph you could see the temperature start going down. I am very certain from looking at the red line on he graph.,3
"When I kept the carbon emissions at 100% on the model, the temperature on the graph averaged between 2.5 and 4°C. After letting the year on the model go to about 2023, I decreased the human carbon emissions to 75%, and started to see a gradual decrease in temperatures. I then continued to decrease the human emissions to 50%, and the temperature decreased even further, averaging about -2°C. ",3
"My experiments showed that humans are the problem with CO2 emissions. When I made the change from 200% to 100%, it clearly showed the temperature change. The temperature climbed on the model, and more ice coverage occurred. When I made the change from 100% to 0%, it changed even more so that ice was almost covering all of it, and the temperature went down drastically. ",3

"I chose 4 as my certainty rate because from the model shown above, it was evident that when you increased human emissions, the global temperatures would also increase (along with the carbon dioxide). As the graph also shows, the water vapor is also increased, which also factors into the increase in the temperature. Plus other things on the model also help show what affects temperature.",3

"It seems like any slight change in emissions has an effect on the atmosphere. For example, if you were to put slightly less emissions into the atmosphere, then that would slightly change the carbon dioxide levels which would most likely cause a slight decrease in temperature and would cause less water vapor in the atmosphere. This decrease of temperature would allow for the ocean to absorb excess greenhouse gases. Any slight change to the environment has and effect. It's the butterfly effect. ",3

"When the slider was on 100%, temperatures were still sharply increasing. This showed that clearly the percent will not be above 100% and most likely not 75%. That eliminated from 101% and up in emission levels. The slider placed on modeling 75% emissions started to show increasing temperatures start to slow in temperature change. The rate was very slow. This demonstrated 50% was most likely the magic number. Sure enough, 50% lead to temperatures gradually decreasing.

"My experiments were accurate and precise, and using the graph, I could accurately determine how much carbon must be removed from the atmosphere. Additionally, because I completed my experiments slowly, I could take into account more data, adding accuracy to my conclusions. To add on, the model makes me certain that I am correct because it shows that when the carbon is decreased, less ice can form, showing that heat can reach the ground without being absorbed by carbon. Therefore, I am very certain about my claim. ",3
I am fairly certain because these two factors have huge effects on the global temperature. If humans release fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere it will lead to less heat being trapped and that will cause the temperatures to decrease. Also if there is more ice covering the Earth's surface the temperatures will decrease due to the ,4
