"I believe it is this because of the thousands of years passing on with the temperature rising and decreasing and even staying the same. This graph shows us the carbon dioxide over 50 years which really helps us try and understand the graph. For example in 325,000 years before present had the highest concentration of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide increases greatly as the years go by because as the time goes by it begins to decrease then stay at a constant rate for a few years then go back up. It increases to all the way around 285 pph at the closest time to the present. It increases greatly which means the temperature increases greatly and it it helps with the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. ",2

"The Keeling curve only shows carbon dioxide levels for the past 50 years or so. The Earth has had an atmosphere for over 4 billion (4,000,000,000) years. 
It is not until recently that humans have been able to measure carbon dioxide levels. How can we know what carbon dioxide levels were in the more distant past?
Atmospheric gases are stored in the spaces between ice crystals in the snow and ice of glaciers and ice sheets. Scientists drill holes into the ice to extract ice cores. Older layers of ice are at the bottom, with younger layers on top.
When sections of the ice are melted in the lab, scientists can measure the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases that were trapped when the ice formed. The levels of trapped gas are measured in parts per million (ppm). A measurement of 350 ppm CO2 means that for every one million (1,000,000) gas molecules, 350 of them are carbon dioxide.",3

the temperature must have decreased a bit if the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and maybe a bit more of infrared radiation was released ,3

I put a certainty rating of 5 because i read the graph and seen the data and predicted thats the average tempature increase that we will see in the next 90 years.,3
unless something crazy happens the world will continuse to get hotter ,2
The graph influenced my certainty rating.,2

"the evidence above kinda ""proves"" that the temperatures will continue to increase slowly, but not much for the temperatures be line A or decrease so much that it would be line C",2

At no point does the temperature just drop and continue to go down.,2
At no point does the temperature just drop and continue to go down. The graph shows a steady increase in temperature.,3
i'm not fully certain but i'm not completely not having a clue either . honestly i think we may get a little bit hotter and the temp might go up but every year the temps almost the same amount every season.,2
You never know what happens the weather could just randomly chnage after a while.,1
You never know what happens the weather could just randomly change after a while.,1
the graph above. it hasn't decreased and has been steadily increasing.,3
In the past the temperature increased and the B and C line showed the temperature decreasing and looking at the graph it showes it should continue to increase. ,3
the graph shows that the temp is going do,2
the graph shows that the temp is going down. the graph shows you that it has already started to go down,3

I'm certain that in the future Line B's temperature will stay the same. while A will increase it's temperature and C will decrease it's temperature.,2
I'm certain that in the future Line B's temperature will stay the same. while A will increase it's temperature and C will decrease it's temperature.,2
I'm certain that in the future Line B's temperature will stay the same. while A will increase it's temperature and C will decrease it's temperature. It stays the same because the line started in 1880 and kept going in line B.,2
I'm certain that this will help us predict in the future because Line B states it will stay the same.,2

I'm certain that the temperature will stay the same in the future.,1
I'm certain that the temperature will stay the same. The graph shows that the Temperature will trend to 2100.,2
I'm certain that the temperature will stay the same. The graph shows that the temperature will trend to 2100. The running mean's temperature started at 1880 and the stopped at 2010 in the graph.,3

i looked back at the evidnence and look and look over,1

I looked at the graph and thought of what the likeliest scenario would be. I determined that it would be the steady increasing of global average temperature. I am somewhat certain in my answer.,2

The graph shows the temperature increasing throughout thr years and i think it will continue to do so throughout the year ,3
i think that it would follow the trend that it has followed for many years ,2

The graph is show that is decreasing up and down.,3
if i picked a the temperature would be rising to much and if i picked c the temperature would be dropping a little to much,2

We must stop doing these things that pollute our environment and should save some energy to help the environment.,3

becuse if you look at the graph it shows exjackly what i said.,2
becuse if you look at the graph it shows exjackly what i said. becaues the blue line witch is line b show that its is changeing but it sateds in the same ragen.,2
follows the trend of the past 20-40 years,2
