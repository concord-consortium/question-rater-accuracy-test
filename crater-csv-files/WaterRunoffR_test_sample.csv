We know that sidewalks and what not are impermeable so aquifers below wont catch an rainfall since those are blocking it.,3
"Based o previous examples in these questions, aquifers are better charged when they are surrounded by permeable rocks, and have a harder time being recharged when surrounded by impermeable rocks. One answer to one of these questions was that urban areas have impermeable rocks that are used to build, so if there is an aquifer underneath an urban area with impermeable rock surrounding it, the rainfall will not be able to get into the ground and recharge the aquifer.",2

However, I always leave room for error in my answers.",2
"i am very certain about my claim because most of urban surfaces are impermeable,water cannot flow through impermeable surfaces, and water runs off to other places that are more permeable. even though there are some grassy areas that retain pools that prevent water from running out of the area, so they could recharge the aquifers",4
basic knowledge,1
There is some type of water recharging however not all the water infiltrates.,3

I am not fully certain but I am moslty certain becasue this whole time this big city has been on top of he soil and water has not been able to get through to the soil. If the soil was made out of clay that would change the answer.,2
I am not fully certain but I am moslty certain becasue this whole time this big city has been on top of he soil and water has not been able to get through to the soil. If the soil was made out of clay that would change the answer. The water  now runs off the soil and into streams because it is not able to get through underneath the city,2
I am certain because due to condensation ,0
I am certain because in the image there is less infiltration in the urban area because of the buildings. And in the rural area it is able to be recharged.,3
"I am certain because in the image there is less infiltration in the urban area because of the buildings. And in the rural area it is able to be recharged. Some limitations can depend on how many impermeable surfaces there are, and how many rain fall we get, and also how fast evaporation come.",4
I picked 3 because I am not sure where water goes in impermeable areas but in the models the water in urban areas flows through the streets ,3
I am sorta certain that the low permeability is low. The river rises as it rains but it drys up as the weather warms up and theres no humidity in the air.  ,2

I am very certain because of prior knowledge. Not only because of this but also because I drew my answer from the image above. On this picture you can see how in urban areas there is much runoff. Which doesn't give the water enough time to recharge,3
"Depending on how much it rains in the area, the aquifer might not fill up as fast to the point where it was found",3
Because most rainfall does make it to the ground water in rural areas ,1
"with the way that impermeability works, the water isn't able to go through the water, and if it can't go through the water, then it can't replenish th",3
water cannot get into the ground in urban areas because the ground is more paved.,2
the charts show water going under groun and refilling them ,2
I am very certain about my answer because I understand aquifers and how they recharge. But I chose a 4 as my certainty rating because I do not fully uunderstand pemeability. ,1
"if a place is impermeable, then it will not have any water flow going through the surface because the sediment and pavement is too thick",3
because the graph shows a diagram of the water flow through the rock and it is very little water flow,3

i know some things about this one and it made it easier on me. i also knew that if is recharged by rainfall. so that was a easy answer.,1
i know some things about this one and it made it easier on me. i also knew that if is recharged by rainfall. so that was a easy answer. but how could it get recharged? because if it can then i don't know how it could or something. ,1
I know that in order to recharge an aquifer it needs water and rain could easily recharge it. ,2
I know that in order to recharge an aquifer it needs water and rain could easily recharge it. ,2
I put 3 because i'm certain i got my answer from the text up above.,1
i scored my certain rate a 1 because i honestly didn't know how to explain the aquifers that lie beneath urban areas recharge by rainfall.,2

yes,0
i don't feel very good about this one ,1
in the grapgh it,2
in the graph it shows all impermeable surfaces and how slow the water is flowing,3
Im confident that the water is collected by aquifers in the groundwater stream which is replenished by rain.,2
my reading,1
the possibilities of sewers and stuff that the water runs into and then gets swept away,2
The water eventually flows in to the ground and the you can see it gets turned into runoff,2
With the information i read above i was able to collect and read it and so i answer the question and explanation by using the information i got ,2
in one of the previous passages permeability ,2
in one of the previous passages permeability is a large factor in how the water gets into the ground and the streets don't allow any water through,2
The diagram influenced my certainty rating ,2
"The diagram influenced my certainty rating due to it showing how the water flows, where it comes from, and where it goes.",2

farmers use them to keep crops hydrated,1

reading the paragraph influenced my claim. i am sorta certain because i read about the aquifers and what they do ,2
I think thats how it works but not very sure.,0
the source of water underneath  low premeability rocks relie on underground streams and wells,1
if the rock was impermeable the water couldnt go through the ground so the aquifers couldnt refill.,4
I am certain about my answer because the modle says that there is low ground water flow and that there is a low recharge rate for the urban aquifers ,2

That is why I gave it a certainty rating of three because the model having a good amount of evidence ,3
i am very certain of my answer because models show that water cant go through non-permeability surfaces.,3
im not sure if all urban areas are the same when it comes to how permiabl they are.,2

I used details from the chart and information from previous activities to answer. I am confident in my answer because what I stated is correct to my knowledge and I answered based on all the information I have learned.,2
kinda gave an explain nation,1
Rainfall can not be controlled.  Aquifers have to be recharged by the rainfall.,2
Rivers in an urban area are more likely to flood during heavy rains and during dry periods because its receives more of its water through runoffs and less from the ground. aquifers in urban areas are not rechargeable by rainfall because the surface is impermeable  otherwise water would infiltrate into the ground forcing it to runoff  into rivers and streams witch might not allow water to sit very long for it to absorb into the ground and recharge aquifers ,3

all of the surfaces in a city is non-permeability surfaces and that makes it to where the water cant flow down into the underground aquifers ,2
in one of the leasons we looked at the things that water could go through and ting that have a very low permeability cant let water through it and cities are made of nothing but very low permeability surfaces ,3

"i'm still kind of iffy on aquifers. i know that aquifers are part of the water cycle. the water cycle is a never ending cycle. i am certain about my response because we as people need water and the water cycle helps with that because when it rains, the water fills up the lakes, rivers, and ponds, and the left over water evaporates back up into the clouds.",2
