The water evaporated during spring and summer and was gone by fall.,4
The water levels are low in the spring and there is no water in the summer.,4
I examined the  photos and clearly none of the water was left in the summer.,4
The water level went down between spring and summer,3
Water evaporated and dried up.,4
The water fell because in the spring the water is there to help plants grow and in the summer there isnt a lot of water because the sun is out biggest part of the time.,5
"At winter there was a full water area, then by spring the water area wasn't as full and when summer came along there was no water left in that area. A water table is the highest level of water in an unconfined aquifer and the level between spring and summer is obviously falling because its drained by summer.",6
The water overtime will being to rise until it gets really cold then it will start to go back down because their is not enough wind to keep pushing it so it stops flowing. ,4
because in the spring rain will come ,4
Summer and spring are both sort of dry seasons. Summer would dry most of the groundwater up and spring would only give off little showers. there still wouldn't be as much water as there during fall and winter. ,5
its a low lying area,1
If the water table rose then the water level would have got higher. it got lower since ther is no water left between spring ans summer.,3

The temperature outside is hot and it drys up the water. And there is less water in the summer do to shortage of rain fall.,6
In the picture shows that spring had water and when it comes to summer its all dried up.,6
"In the pictures above, the spring picture has water where it seems that there is no water in the summer.",4
The pictures represent how the water table reacts to the seasons. I feel like the water table fell between spring and summer for the reason of the water in winter was frozen and then in spring it was unfrozen and then in summer it was gone.,4
The pictures represent how the water table reacts to the seasons. I feel like the water table fell between spring and summer for the reason of the water in winter was frozen and then in spring it was unfrozen and then in summer it was gone. the sun is what changes the water table and depending on waht season your in the sun may show up a lot or just a little bit. In the summer there is no water for the reason of the suns rays beaming on the water causing the water to evaporate from the ground or from a pond. In the winter the sun isn't there to evaporate the water so the cold temperatures cause the water to freeze and remain still.,6
The water that can seen in the pictures appears to go from high to almost none. The water has either been soaked into the ground or evaporated due to the hot weather temperature.,6

we use more water in the summer time ,4

all the sunlight makes us have less water when the suns out and its hot the water drys up and we don't hardy have any water ,4
There is much less water in the picture of summer,4
The water fell between the spring and summer the reason why is that the heat took the water away.,3
in spring there was still water but by summer the water was all gone which mean it other evaporated or flow elsewhere. ,5

the water table fell because drought most likly happen during spring and summer months,3
the water table fell because drought most likely happen during spring and summer months due to the ground being warm and water can easily flow through,4
The water level is lower so the water table fell.,3
there is a lot of water that comes in during that time so it rises.,3
spring has a turn of water because it not don't change,3

The water is evaporated or out to use in some way during spring and summer meaning there will be less water in the water table. This means that the table has lowered in the time between the spring and summer. ,4
based upon the pictures the water obviously did not rise between spring and summer. the sun dried up all of the water from the spring to the summer time.,4
The water table lowering caused the water to seep back into the ground.,4
"This is because the water is no longer there in the summer, meaning that it had to flow out.  And the water flows out of ponds when the water table is low.",5
I think the water table rose between spring and summer because in the winter you can see that the water is frozen over. ,3

There is no water left in the area by the summer.,4

There is less water on the surface,4
The water has flowed out of the stream indicating that the water table is lowered ,3
The hotter it gets the more the water will evaporate.,5

All of the water dried up between the summer and spring.,4
All of the water dried up between the summer and spring. In the winter it was very cold so the water froze but by spring the temperature got warmer so the water was able to unfreeze and summer the temperature was hot so the water got dried up.,5
The level of water decreased in between spring and summer because of the heat and sun causing evaporation. Also water level decreased because of new plants and trees coming in absorbing the water.,6
The level of water decreased in between spring and summer because of the heat and sun causing evaporation. Also water level decreased because of new plants and trees coming in absorbing the water.,6
During spring and summer there is more precipitation or rain which means that it will make the water table rise. The unconfined aquifer will gain more water from all the rain falling into it. The water flow will go towards the unconfined aquifer.,5
The water level dried up and keeps drying as it keeps getting warmer. All of the water gets sucked into the plants.,6

i think the water level will raise before spring and the summer because it it getting warm again and that means more poeple an animals will be using the water ,4
The water got closer to the surface and distributed itself through the surface in the summer.,4

During the spring the water unfroze and began to be absorbed into the ground and then by summer the water is fully absorbed into the ground until either drilled up or rained on enough to have it flood.,6

the  water table has fell between spring an summer because thats when it all starts to get hot so the water dries up and theres no need for a water table then.,5
