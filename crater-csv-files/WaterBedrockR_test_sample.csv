As shown in the picture water cannot flow through its the base. This sediment is low in porosity and low in permeability.,3
In the picture ablove you can see that the bedrock has no holes so the water couldnt get through and the porosity is number of holes so therefore it would be low porosity.  For the permeability you can see in the picture that the water is sitting on top of the rock and not going through so in order for it to be permeable the water would have to beable to go through it.,3

I think it is 4 because it is only one picture of the bedrock so that is not saying all bedrock is the same some bedrock might have different porosity and permeability,3

What influenced my certainty rating is the fact the bed rock is a solid which nothing can pass through it therefore having no permeability. The rock also has ZERO holes therefore having no porosity.  I would be able to provide better information with more pictures of the bed rock but due to little data I cannot provide enough. But with the resources given I am very certain.  jl,3

What influenced my certainty rate is that I examined the close up pictures of the bedrock and it looks like the bedrock does not have many holes which means water can not flow through it good and I know if a rock has low porosity there will be low permeability because if a rock had high permeability the water would flow better through the rock. ,3

my answer came from the text,1
I am very certain that my answer is correct because the models showed bedrock and from the model I could tell it is highly difficult for water to pass through bedrock because it has low porosity and low permeability.,3
"I am very certain that my answer is correct because the models showed bedrock and from the model I could tell it is highly difficult for water to pass through bedrock because it has low porosity and low permeability. These pictures help show us that bedrock is a solid with little to no holes, unlike gravel which contains many holes and has high porosity, and high permeability.",3
what influenced my certainty rating was the bedrock. bedrock is at the very bottom and it is tightly packed together ,2
