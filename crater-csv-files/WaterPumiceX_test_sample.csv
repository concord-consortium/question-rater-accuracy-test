Pumice would have low porosity and low permeability. It would have high porosity and low permeability because in the picture above the pumice rock is floating because water is not flowing through it. The unconnected holes don´t allow the water to go through the pumice. If the pumice had connected holes water would be able to go through the rock. Since the rock has a lot of holes but not opened ones the rock would be high porosity and low permeability. ,6
