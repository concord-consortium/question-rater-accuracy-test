The graph shows temperature increases when water vapor gets in the atmosphere. When co2 causes more water to be evaporated then the air temperature increases.,4
"If there is more carbon dioxide then the levels of water vapor are bound to increase because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that heats the earth. This causes temperatures to rise and allows for more evaporation to occur. If there is more evaporation, then there will be more water vapor in the atmosphere. If the ocean is emitting more water vapor in the atmosphere, then it will be more difficult for it to soak up the carbon dioxide. ",3
