"If a flow-back well is place the water is allowed to ""flow back"" into the ground. The well is absorbing the water, and being thrown somewhere. After, the water is absorbed into the ground where it can return back to the aquifer.",3
For water to pass through a sediment/rock it must be permeable. Bedrock is a sediment that doesn't allow water to go through. If the ground is permeable then the flow back wells can release there water and resupply there water back from themselves causing a everlasting cycle or until a drought comes.,3
After studying the difference of non-flowbacks and flowbacks; i better understand the water in takes are better to be put in a rural area in which they can easily be recharged with percipataion instead of being put in an urban area.,2

All the other sources use up the water without returning it to the aquifer. These two are much more efficient and the net water loss is much less.,2
the interactive lesson proved that flow back wells are more efficient than the non flow back wells as the non flow back wells don't replenish the aquifers,2

The water may not be clean but it is healthier then city water,1
I am sure since the model represented this exact senario.,1
The graph showed that urban well has a higher well output for 6 years.,2
"True that flow back wells do have a bad side, for example, they pump out less water, and no flowback wells igh have been a better option in rare casses.",2
I noticed that the well output graph's rural wells both have the exact same well output level. So I know that the rural well pumped to the city has more sustainable water ,2

I chose this answer because the model played out with the wells. The ,1
in the model experiment only permeable surfaces allow recharge of underlying aquifers. And wastewater treatment plant could discharge to an area that would recharge the urban aquifer. And what influenced me to be very certain is because I use the model to get my information to be so certain. ,4
