"In the model if you adjust the slider to the right which is making the climate warmer, the amount of water vapor increases and the same could be said for the other way. The colder the climate got the less water vapor ",3
"The graph shows the water vapor doing the same thing as the carbon dioxide, so in i take it that they have the same effect.",2
"If the temperature influences the water vapor , then the water vapor shouldnt affect the temperature because the temperature is what determines the amount of water vapor in the air.",2
The modules and graphs.,2
Water vapor is dense causing the air to heat up. ,2
I feel pretty confident in my answer I am not for sure if it the best answer but I have a feeling that I got it right from the evidence I used from the graph. ,1
I am very certain about my explanation because of the influence the graphs and models had on my thinking. Greenhouse gases trap heat and water vapor is a greenhouse gas  meaning it will retain the heat and increase the temperature.,3
The atmosphere is where the vaporized water goes up into allowing it to create big and better clouds depending on the waters boiling point which will then allow the water to rise back up into the atmosphere.  ,3

The graphs influenced my answer because of the well drawn data and its movement. the model also influenced my answer because I could see how the greenhouse gas and the water vapor reacted with each other. ,2
The graphs influenced my answer because of the well drawn data and its movement. the model also influenced my answer because I could see how the greenhouse gas and the water vapor reacted with each other. Im a little uncertain about my response because the model had a lot going on within it. It was sort of hard for me to keep up with it all. ,2

The graphs influenced my answer because of the well drawn data and its movement. the model also influenced my answer because I could see how the greenhouse gas and the water vapor reacted with each other. The model made me uncertain because I wasn't sure how the greenhouse gases were supposed to affect the energy packets. ,2
"The graph showed me that if the temperature would increase so would the water vapor, and since they correspond and they do what the other does maybe the temperature would do what the water vapor does.",2
"The graph showed me that if the temperature would increase so would the water vapor, and since they correspond and they do what the other does maybe the temperature would do what the water vapor does. The model shows me that it is increasing or decreasing.",3
"The graph showed me that if the temperature would increase so would the water vapor, and since they correspond and they do what the other does maybe the temperature would do what the water vapor does. The model shows me that it is increasing or decreasing. The model needs to be show more numbers and be more specific.",3
