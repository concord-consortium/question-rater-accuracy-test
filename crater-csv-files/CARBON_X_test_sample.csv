I looked and i examined the graph and even the graph shows that all temperature has been doing is increasing and I don't think it will stop unless factors in the future change and i also don't see that happening.,3
The graph clearly shows how the Earth's temperature is not cooling off but instead increasing even more so there is no solid evidence that it wont continue to increase.,3

I put a certainty rating of 5 because i read the graph and seen the data and predicted thats the average tempature increase that we will see in the next 90 years.,3
unless something crazy happens the world will continuse to get hotter ,2

At no point does the temperature just drop and continue to go down.,2
At no point does the temperature just drop and continue to go down. The graph shows a steady increase in temperature.,3
i'm not fully certain but i'm not completely not having a clue either . honestly i think we may get a little bit hotter and the temp might go up but every year the temps almost the same amount every season.,2
You never know what happens the weather could just randomly chnage after a while.,1
You never know what happens the weather could just randomly change after a while.,1
the graph above. it hasn't decreased and has been steadily increasing.,3
In the past the temperature increased and the B and C line showed the temperature decreasing and looking at the graph it showes it should continue to increase. ,3

I'm certain that in the future Line B's temperature will stay the same. while A will increase it's temperature and C will decrease it's temperature.,2
I'm certain that in the future Line B's temperature will stay the same. while A will increase it's temperature and C will decrease it's temperature.,2
I'm certain that in the future Line B's temperature will stay the same. while A will increase it's temperature and C will decrease it's temperature. It stays the same because the line started in 1880 and kept going in line B.,2
I'm certain that this will help us predict in the future because Line B states it will stay the same.,2

I looked at the graph and thought of what the likeliest scenario would be. I determined that it would be the steady increasing of global average temperature. I am somewhat certain in my answer.,2
