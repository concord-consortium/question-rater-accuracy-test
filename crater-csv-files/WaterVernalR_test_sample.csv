I am pretty sure the answer is right but I do not know for sure so I just marked it a three ,1
The pictures and the new knowledge I learned through the other questions I just answered. A water table is the highest level of water in an unconfined aquifer. So that means that the water level of the water table is falling because there is no water by summer.,3
Didnt really understand fully on how to answer to question. ,0
because very spring storms come this makes pools of rain rise ,1
I've seen how the seasons effect the amount of water that makes it into the ground. I've seen how differently the water goes through the process when it is warm or cold. ,2

My brother helped me,1
The graph clearly shows that the winter amount was a lot less than spring and summer. The water wasn't as high and had soaked completely in the ground by this time.,3

"Scientific evidence includes: the area got drier from spring to summer and the water table is the top surface of the unconfined aquifer. Students may also state that the temperature is higher in the summer than the spring, leading to increased evaporation of the surface.",3
"Between all three seasons, the water level seemed the least during the summer, and it seemed to be going down during the spring. During the summer and the spring, there could be a potential drought, or long periods without water, which would be a factor for the water table decreasing.",2

The height of the water fell.,2
See above answer ,1

I am mostly sure because the last section ,1
"I am mostly sure because the last section had a small reading section about how the water table shows how much water is on the ground. The pictures show that the higher the water table, the lower the level of water will be in the pond. The water table is at its highest in the summer, which is why there is no water in the pond. It has all been absorbed as groundwater. ",3
using background knowledge and visual evidence shown in the photographs.,2
The less evaporations in the seasons would lead to higher water table,2
I noticed in the picture that the water drained throughout the season.,2
I am not so familiar with water tables and do not know how reliable these images are. I am not confident enough in the resources provided to give a definite answer.,2
I am not so familiar with water tables and do not know how reliable these images are. I am not confident enough in the resources provided to give a definite answer. However based on the definition of the water table this makes sense that there was a drop in water table from spring to summer.,3

I am very certain because there is not water in the summer ,2
I am very certain because there is not water in the summer picture however there was a noticeable amount of water in the spring picture.,3
I'm just right man,0
"i am very certain about my answer because you can see in the drawings that when it was colder more water was at the surface then when it was near spring and summer time, if the water table hadnt have fallen the water at the surface would still be visible ",3

In the picture we see how the water despaired completely due to the evaporation or it got observer by plants. The falls between these seasons.,3
The pictures influenced my certainty becasue you can see in the picture that there was alot of water and it was frozen in the winter and then in the spring the water was still present but not frozen anymore but by summer the water was all dried up,3
The pictures influenced my certainty becasue you can see in the picture that there was alot of water and it was frozen in the winter and then in the spring the water was still present but not frozen anymore but by summer the water was all dried up,3
I am certain of this because evaporation does absorb water and so do the plants and trees that are coming in or growing due to the change in seasons.,2
"I am certain because from looking at the pictures, the water decreases as seasons get hotter. Spring and Summer cause evaporation absorbing water from the pool decreasing the water level. Also new plants and trees coming in use the water to grow. Which is all decreasing the water level. I am certain ",4
Since there is more rainfall or precipitation during the seasons of Spring and Summer the water table will rise because there will be more water going towards or into the unconfined aquifer. The water flow will be going towards the aquifer. ,3
"I choose 3 because, I am certain that the reason why the water had dried up was only because of the heat. Also because the plants take in the water to. The amount of water in all the pictures is decresing and we know seasons tend to be different. ",3

i am certain about this knowing that summer everything goes because that is when the sun is out more and its more heat too so we need water and the other living things need water. This is why the picture shows the lake like they are. ,2
