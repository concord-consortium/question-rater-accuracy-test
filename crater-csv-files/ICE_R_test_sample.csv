Ice reflects sunlight and with less of it then more heat will be absorbed by earth.,3
I am not for sure if my answer is right but I also do not think that my answer is wrong so that is why I choose the number 3 for my rating because I was not for sure on my answer. ,1
"The graphs and models influenced my certainty level for my explanation. The color white reflects sunlight and ice is white meaning its going to reflect the suns light keeping temperatures cool, but if the ice melts then there's just the dark sea to take its place and that's just going to absorb the suns light warming up the earths temperature, which is why in the year of 2100 temperatures are going to increase earths temperatures.",3

In all the graphs it has shown that CO2 was causing the temperature to increase.Nothing about ice. Also since the temperature has been increasing thats what melting all the ice.,2
"The graph is decreasing through out time so i just said what the  graph was showing.

The graph shows that the temperature from 1978 to 2010 has been decreasing ever since then. ,2
Due to the graph showing that the temperature is increasing and that the snow/ice coverage is decreasing then it is easy to predict when all the graphs and evidence point to no coverage.,3
the graph above shows and it keeps dropping so it will be dropping in 2100,2
The graph gave me a good visual in order  to answer the questions with more confidence but Im not too confident in my response.,2
im not really sure on what the question is asking ,1
"The graphs and models shown before show that with less ice, the higher the temperatures. if the ice continues decreasing it would cause the earth to heat up as it would have less coverage to protect it from the suns radiation.",3
The ice melts over time when the temperature get warmer. ,2
The ice melts over time when the temperature get warmer. The CO2 makes it hot out side to make the ice melt.,2
if you follow the trend it is reletively easy to predict what the ice will be in the year 2100,2

During the time periods from 1978-2010 the temperature is decreasing by a great amount. Since there has been less ice because of Global warming then that means the heat from the sun reflecting on the ocean rises into the sky. The trend is showing the less ice the hotter it is. ,3

My certainty rating was influenced by the graph shown above. The graph above shows that the trend will continue to decrease in the amount of ice resulting in less alebdo.,3
as the amount of ice cover decreases temperatures begin to increase this is due to a lower amount of sunlight being reflected back into space causing earths temps to rise,3

"In a lot of the past activities I came to the same conclusion. The melting of ice leads to the warming of the earth because it lowers earth's albedo. Which allows more heat to be absorbed by the earth, causing the earth to heat up.  ",3

The graph makes me certain that as time goes on, the extent of ice will decrease  and the temperature will increase.",3
I am very certain Becuase if there isn't any snow then there is less albedo so less light is reflected so the tempature on earth would go up. It would get  Hotter,3

Of their is no ice the. The energy will continue to accumulate and it will continuously warm the Earth ,1
According to the graph the ice is going away very fast so this means that the temperature will increase due to less ice,3

I'm fairly certain because I know that ice reflects solar radiation which causes a decrease in temperature so once the ice is removed there will be an increase in temperature because there won't be as much of an extent that will help decrease temperature ,3
I am extremely certain because according to the graph as time goes on temperature decrease which means the ice melts at a quicker rate. In this model it shows the downward trend of temperature and ice so as long as this continues there will be less ice in 2100.,3
I am fairly certain because the graph is showing a negative trend in the amount of albedo. This means that less of the sun's energy is being reflected which will heat up the Earth. The average ice coverage is shown on the graph as decreasing which will decrease albedo which increases temperature. ,3

Albedo is the amount of solar radiation reflected back into space, and since solar radiation heats the Earth, if the albedo, or the reflection of solar radiation, was less, temperatures would increase.

I am very certain about my explanation because I ave understood the information given and fully answered the question asked. ,1
"My certainty rating was influenced by my knowledge of the effects of albedo, reflectivity, and what increases Earth's temperature. When the Earth has a lesser albedo due to the less amount of reflective sources, more of the sun's radiation and heat will be absorbed and the Earth will heat up as a result. The graph gives me the information that the sea ice extent is evidently decreasing. However, a possible weakness to this argument is that cloud cover also has a big effect on refl",3

The graph gives me the information that the sea ice extent is evidently decreasing. However, a possible weakness to this argument is that there is a limited amount that we can learn from this graph prior to knowing the actual albedo of sea, ice, and clouds. ",3
The graph shows a decrease in ice extent which means that the albedo will drop. This drop in reflection allows for more energy to stay in the ,3
"I am pretty certain of my answer. This is because ice causes the sea surface to darken, which causes it to absorb more radiation, which causes Earth's temperature to increase, which causes more sea ice to melt. However, the trend in the graph may change over time as new factors are introduced and the Earth might start retaining the amount of sea ice it holds or increasing it.",3

"I rated my certainty as a 4 because I am sure that my conclusions based off of the provided data from the graph is correct. However, I am uncertain as to whether or not what I have concluded about solar radiation is accurate.",2

The graph clearly shows that ice extent is continuing to decrease and will continue to decrease in the future. However, the limitations of the graph are that it is only over about a 30 year period and the extent of glaciers in future years may drastically change suddenly.

"I am fairly certain about my answer because I used the graph to support what I believe in. Even though I agree with the graph, some people may say that the graph is going to start to increase when it is 2100 because the graph ends in 2010, and we're in 2018, where we have rising temperatures. However, usually after a global warming there is an ice age, so the temperatures could increase. ",2
"facts that influenced my rating are that from previos lessons we leanrws that a higher albedo reflects solar radation while lower albedo absorbs solar radion.. absorption of solar radiation ;eads to increased temperautre, and lastly rhat the trrend on the graph shows a decrease in ice in the arctic.

I chose my certainty rating as a four because scientific evidence states that the more solar radiation absorbed causes an increase in temperature.  ,2

Lands with light colors generally have lower albedos which reflect the energy and darker colors absorb more energy because they have higher albedos.,3
The graph ,2
The graph backs up my answer. ,2
Throughout all the data that was shown all the evidence was pointing out that the more ice that is exposed the cooler the atmosphere becomes but when there is a lack of ice the temperature rises and the Average Monthly Arctic Sea Ice Extent July 1978 to 2010 graph is showing the scenario quite well because of the decline. ,3

The graph above showing decresing ice and the knowledge that with less ice comes higher temperatures I am certain that Earth will have higher tempertures in 2100 if the ice cover continues to follow this trend.,3
The previous knowledge on decreasing ice means a rise in temperature and on the graph it shows the ice start to melt away.,3
"The only fault in the graph that could prove this theory wrong is any data points in between the years. If it is spiking up and down between each year, then that means that ",3
The graph is understandable with the extent of the ice in the poles over the years and you can tell that there is a definite effect over all. You can see that over the years the ice extend doesn't go as far,3
my certainty rating is based on the fact that the graph shows a very exact downward trend,2
"my certainty rating is based on the fact that the graph shows a very exact downward trend, like in there was 10.5 millioan square ks of sea ice esxtent as where in 2010 ther was only 8.5 million square kilometer of sea ice extenet. ",3
