"They are not recharged because the aquifers beneath urban areas are covered by concrete and other impermeable sediments. Because of this, the water cannot enter or leave the ground, so once the water in the aquifer is used, it cannot be refilled. ",6
not usually due to the vast amount of sidewalks and roads,3
Rain cant permeate through urban surfaces,3
The surfaces are impermeable and will not allow precipitation to go through.,5
The water can not penetrate through the impermeable surfaces that the urban areas are made up of.,5
"Drains and pipes, etc. can replenish these aquifers with purifying practices, too ",2
"They are not recharged because all of the water goes to the streams and rivers and just floods, barely any is absorbed in the ground because there is no grass or trees.",4
Aquifers below urban areas are unable to be recharged by rain because the ground above these aquifers is impermeable.,4
The water from the rainfall can not reach the aquifer because of the multitude of impermeable surfaces.,5
Yes because when it rains the water soaks down into the ground eventually making its way to the aquifer.,3
Yes because when it rains the water soaks down into the ground eventually making its way to the aquifer. As shown in the image through condensation and precipitation the water soaks into the round and based on the angling of the soil the water flows to the aquifer.,4
The impermeable sediments/rock make it hard for water to recharge the aquifers that lie beneath the urban areas.,4
"No, because the water cannot seep into the ground due to impermeable rocks used in urban areas.",5
"No, because the water cannot seep into the ground due to impermeable rocks used in urban areas.",5
"aquifers beneath urban areas are largely not recharged by rainfall because the surfaces are impermeable. water that would otherwise infiltrate into the ground is forced to run off into rivers and streams, which may not allow the water to sit very long so that it can be absorbed into the ground to recharge aquifers",6
because water cant reach them,3
It depends because  there is things from a urban area that stops water from recharging. As we see in the picture roofs and houses stop water. ,3
It depends because  there is things from a urban area that stops water from recharging. As we see in the picture roofs and houses stop water from infiltrating. some type of water goes though.,4
No the building have been on the soil so long and the land beneath is so dry and dead that it would be very hard for just rainfall to recharge that soil. It would be alot easier to recharge the soil if the land was how it used to be without the buildings and concrete on top of it.,5

It would be alot easier to recharge the soil if the land was how it used to be without the buildings and concrete on top of it. The water would flow right off the soil and go into streams. ,5
The aquifers that lie beneath urban areas are recharged by rain fall due to the soil or ground absorbing the water and recharging the aquifer. ,3
"No, the aquifers beneath us cannot be recharge because in our urban area we have to many impermeable surfaces, such as roads, side walks, and buildings. This allows no water and no infiltration to be absorbed by the ground. Making the aquifer not able to be recharged.",6

"Aquifers that lie beneath urban areas are recharged faster than aquifers in rural areas because most urban areas have impermeable surfaces meaning that water does not go into houses, buildings, etc which means more water will flow through streets and more water will get to the aquifers.  ",6
"They recharge with rain... And its not just drying up, the water is just sitting there. ",3
"No, the water isn't able to recharge because of how impermeable the surface is.",4
"No, the water isn't able to recharge because of how impermeable the surface is. When the surface is impermeable, it doesn't allow allow the water to sit too long because it doesn't soak through. As a result, it creates runoffs.",6
"the water from above ground can flow into the aquifer, allowing it stay filled",3
Because all the sidewalks and roads make it so water can't go in the ground.,5
"the layout of urban areas is full of impermeable sediments, which wont let the water go through it and then into the ground water.",5
the water cannot get into the ground.,3
rain fall will recharge any kind of under ground water unless its beneath rock ,3
"Aquifers that lie beneath urban areas recharge by rainfall because the high permeability has large pores, allowing water to flow through the ground, and recharge aquifers. ",3
most of the ground in urban areas is impermeable and thus the water cannot make it through the surface to recharge the well beneath,6
because it is very hard for the ewater to get through the stone because it is impermiable ,4
because the surfaces are impermeable.,3

The aquifers need water to recharge and when it rains the water soaks into the ground and can easily recharge it.,3
The aquifers need water to recharge and when it rains the water soaks into the ground and can easily recharge it. Concrete and roofing affect the flow of water in urban areas which makes it a little bit harder to recharge the aquifers.,5
I think there is because if there's a certain about of water it's able to recharge.,2
aquifers lie beneath urban areas recharged by rainfall because it has a good precipitation ,1
Urbanization has caused low water levels in areas similar to where and aquifer],2
I have no idea what that is,1
Water will travel through the rocks to the lowest point. ,3
Water will travel through the rocks to the lowest point. Everytime it rains they are refilled.,4
they have to be recharged somehow.,2
because of all the rain run off,3
because all thats where are all the water ends up,1
yes,0
yes,0
not as much water from the sky gets to them because of the impermeable surfaces. ,4
not as much water from the sky gets to them because of the impermeable surfaces. ,4
Because water can go through the soil and enter the groundwater stream which is where the aquifer gets its water from.,3
it says in the reading ,2
because the water will eventually get down to them but because of the impermeable things water has to take different paths,3
because the water will eventually get down to them but because of the impermeable things water has to take different paths in the picture you can see the runoff,4
They wouldn't be able to be recharged because unban areas have roads and sidewalks the water cant really go underneath it so it wouldn't be able to be recharged by rainfall.,4
no because the city streets and storm drains keep the ground under dry with no water ,3

"Yes, it sinks into the ground and can be dug up and used.",3
i dont know what aquifers are yet.,0
"yes, because the aquifers absorb the rain and create water way for dried out farms/ land",2
"no because the graph describes it as having low ground water, the stream beside of it dries out, little soil to absorb water, and roofs, roads, and paths stop infiltration.",6
no because there is less ground water flow and without ground water flow there is a less likely chance of water getting into the aquifer in order to recharge it.,4
no because there is less ground water flow and without ground water flow there is a less likely chance of water getting into the aquifer in order to recharge it.,4
"Rain cannot reach underneath the ground therefore, cannot reach the aquifers to recharge them.",3
yes because when it rains is when the aquifers come out .,1
yes because when it rains is when the aquifers come out .,1
Aquifers cant be charged without rainfall.,3
the aquifers that are farther below are usually beneath rock with low premeability and do not allow rain fall to penetrate beneath it.,3
the water flows under the ground and  fills back up the aquifers,2
They are recharged by rainfall but much slow then non-urban areas due to the huge amount of impermeable objects in the urban areas  ,3
They are recharged by rainfall but much slow then non-urban areas due to the huge amount of impermeable objects in the urban areas. in the model also says there is a low ground water flow which means that it dose recharged ,3

no because where urban areas lie on non-permeability surfaces rain water will just stay on the top surfaces.,4
that would  mean that those urban areas are very permiable wich they are not because they are man made and not natural.,3
The aquifers will get there water by rain clouds after the clouds condensate after the waters evaporated from the stream.,2
The reason is that after the water evaporated by the by the clouds they can soon condensate the rain down to the aquifers or in the runoff to fill up the stream.,3
"The reason is that after the water evaporated by the by the clouds they can soon condensate the rain down to the aquifers or in the runoff to fill up the stream. Though the problem we know is that the roofs, roads and paths may stop the infiltration so the water has to go through the runoff.",5

"Yes, but the local rivers that feed off of the aquifer dry up quicker, and water has more trouble reaching the underground aquifer under an urban area than one under a non-urban area.",3
"Yes, but the local rivers that feed off of the aquifer dry up quicker, and water has more trouble reaching the underground aquifer under an urban area than one under a non-urban area. The obstacles preventing major aquifer growth buildings, roads, sidewalks, recreational areas etcetera in urban areas, whereas in non-urban areas those are not present.",5
yes cause rain water has got air in it,2
Rainfall may take longer to recharge aquifers in urban areas because of impermeable surfaces,5
aquifers in urban areas are not rechargeable by rainfall because the surface is impermeable  otherwise water would infiltrate into the ground forcing it to runoff  into rivers and streams witch might not allow water to sit very long for it to absorb into the ground and recharge aquifers ,6
cause the water has no way to get to the aquifer so the aquifer cant get refilled by the rain like all of the other aquifers ,3
the water cant go through non-permeability surfaces so that makes it to where the aquifers under citlies cant get refilled ,5
