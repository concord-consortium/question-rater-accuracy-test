I'm not 100 percent sure I am correct but I feel like I may be which is why i picked 3 im in the middle. The temperature shows it increasing in the graph which led me to my explanation in question 10 which led to my certainity raiting which I feel is in the middle because of my assumptions not the graph itself. ,2

In the graph above it shows the tempatures on the side and from 1180 to 2000 its shows it went up 6 degrees in Celsius which is a whole lot and it may go up now but as time goes by it may go up another 6 degrees or down it could go up and then down some degrees.  ,3

I know that when the ice glaciers melt it isn't covering the water causing it to stay cool. I know the co2 from the ocean will travel into the air which will increase.,3
The temperature shows it increasing in the graph. If you look closely at the graph you can tell from 1880 to around 2010 it increases significantly. There were only little bumps of decrease but overall the temperature rose. From 1180 to 2000 its shows it went up 6 degrees in Celsius which is a lot.,3

I know the c02 coming from the water will be more warm and bounce off into the sky taking that and evaporating it into the air causing it to become hot, only if the glaciers melt, which they are.

From the previous years it shows a trend and that trend did not seem to decrease by a great amount, it decreased then increased by a lot and repeat. It is still rising and I believe it will continue to do so especially because of global warming. ",4
I viewed the graph but I'm not as sure that my answer makes sense.,1
I believe that my argument makes sense because it shows data from the graph and i gave evidence as to why I believe the temperature will go up . In 1980 to 2000 the temperature went up from 0.1 to 0.4.,2
I believe that my certainty makes sense because it shows data from the graph and i gave evidence as to why I believe the temperature will go up . In 1980 to 2000 the temperature went up from 0.1 to 0.4. It shows in the video also how it gets warmer over time like in the graph ,3

in the video they explained how temperature tends to change over extended periods of time .,1
on the other video i watched the temperature was going up and it has been showing on the graphs that the temperature over the years has been going up although the solar system may influence the temperature.,3

The influence of my certainty rating is that if the temperature has been on a constant increase ,2
The influence of my certainty rating is that if the temperature has been on a constant increase since the beginning of the graph there is no evidence to prove that it will slow down or start to decrease so the logical answer would be Line A. In the graph it shows that the increase of temperature is at a constant pace and Line A continues that pace so it would make sense if Line A is would be the possibility.,3
"unless there is a drastic change made, a sudden change in temperature pattern is very unlikely. its logical to choose the path of A which matches the warming trend over the others which contradict it",3
