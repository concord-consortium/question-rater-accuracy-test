"Reducing human emissions by 50% lowered the temperature to the baseline. It also reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide down to 10 in the model. I tried lowering emissions by 25%, but the temperature stayed warm. A lower temperature means that there isn't as much water vapor or as many clouds.",4
"The amount of factories weigh greatly on the co2 emissions but as shown in the model, if humans were to cut the co2 emissions to about 45-50% of what they were in 2010 the earths temperature would slowly cool and become more regular.",3

0-25% and 25-50%  didn't effect the global temperature. The temperature kept decreasing.,3
"If their was a lot of global emissions then the air temperature increased, however solar radiation and global radiation decreased when their was more global emissions. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and in the ocean stayed pretty steady whether their was a lot of human emissions or not.",4
If we cut down emissions to 50% then we can even the average global temperature and keep it the same enough to prevent any effects on the earth.,3
Human emission doesn't really affect the temperature but ice and carbon dioxide does affect it the more ice we have the lower the temperature gets and the less carbon dioxide we have the temperature begins to drop as well ,4
No  human emissions reduced the average global climate. By having no human emissions there is going to be way cooler temperatures than average.,3

Human emissions retain heat making earths temperatures cooler, and if there is no human emissions then nothings trapping in the heat and the earths temperature are significantly colder.",4
Each time i moved the human emissions up by 10% to see how much carbon dioxide would have to be put in the air to change the overall global temperature it was in between 50-75% when i did that the global temperature dropped a big amount and continued to drop over time ,4

the lower the factory thing lower thing to block the heat so it got hotter ,2
"I just turned the emissions down to 50% and there was less clouds, more ice cover, and the temp went down.",5
"First, I put the human emissions all the way to 200% and that melted the ice away completely pretty fast. Secondly, I put human emissions all the way to 0% and it kind of stayed the same as the begging of the model, a little ice formed, and a little melted.",4

When the emissions are at 25-50% the amount of c02 in the atmosphere will drop.,4
"I moved the human emission slider to 150% the temperature was raising, The CO2 in the ocean was raising, also the CO2 in the atmosphere was raising. I moved it up 200% it continued to increase. I brought it down to a 50% it was the temperature is still increasing.  The vapor water didn't increase nor decrease. I took down 0 % and everything started decreasing.",4
"First, I started at the default 100% of human emission, and the started to decrease from there to see when human emission would start decreasing the afftect on the global temperature. Then, I went down to 50%, and then it started to take less affect on the global temp.  and started to decrease in CO2 levels in the atmosphere and increasing in the ocean. Last, I dropped It down to 0%, that where everything started to drop, the temp, atmosphere CO2 levels, even the water vapor levels where decreasing. Then I knew it was beginning to get colder.",5
if we had less factories and industrialization next to the ocean maybe we would have a better environment and a cooler environment.,3
When i lowered the model to 0% then it showed the temperature would still increase and then decrease. So the Earths temperature was still affected without the human attribution made.,3
When i lowered the model to 0% then it showed the temperature would still increase and then decrease. So the Earths temperature was still affected without the human attribution made. When the temperature was low the level of carbon dioxide changed and so did the water vapor levels change.,4

25-50% need to be changed because the temp is not warm enough ,2
"I tried each of the percentages of emissions and only 0% seemed to work. 100-50% all seemed to just keep rising steadily, and when i tried 25% it started to slow its rise in temperature, but it was still rising. When I tried 0% it evened it out for a time and then slowly started to fall.",4

In the experiment above the lower percent of emission you have the lower the temperature drops. as you increase the emission up to 50% or above the temperatures start increasing because of the carbon in the air.,3

i believe high temperatures would be affected by this and co2.,2
with more emissions the tempeture rose along with the co2 in the ocean,4
The outcome of this experiment is that the more people then the colder and colder it go.,2
"well there's the greenhouse effect, loss of sea ice glaciers are melting, accelerated sea levels rise and longer, intense heat waves.",3

in moving the emissions i didn't see much of a change until 100%. lots of things are effecting the temperature other than human emissions though. clouds and ice will decrease temperature. greenhouse gasses and radiation increase temperature.,4
"The outcomes i came up with is because of the way the model is saying with 100% of carbon emissions the temperature only rises. If we reduce this, yes the average temperature changes but it still has potential to be pretty high",4

The outcomes are that the solar radiation and the human emissions play a big factor in that they are both releasing and giving energy to carbon dioxide. Human continually release CO2 into the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels and not using as much alternative energy while they create deforestation among other places. Then the sun creates solar radiation that gives energy that is absorbed by the CO2 and it melts the ice as the CO2 in the atmosphere increases and the tempertures will then rise bring a rise in heating around the world.,5

"When co2 levels were risen, the water vapor was ""rejected"" by the sea and it was forced back into the atmosphere. This made temperatures higher and more clouds formed. When the co2 levels were decreased, the earth took a while to cool itself back down after the co2 emmissions from before. ",4

"In the graph you can see that as you increase human emissions, temperature begins to increase which increases evaporation and decreases the amount of co2 in the ocean. You can see in the model the ice melt as temperature increases. According to my prior knowledge I know that co2 and temperature are directly linked.",4
"The first experiment I tried which was 75% emissions with the model resulted in little to no change in the graphs. So I decreased the emissions further to fifty percent. Here is where I saw a change. After fifty percent was reached on the model, the graphs changed and after increasing in temperature, they decreased noticeably. Thus 50% emission rate is probably the ideal. ",4
If you changed the model down 25% then on the graph you could see the temperature start going down.,3
"When I kept the carbon emissions at 100% on the model, the temperature on the graph averaged between 2.5 and 4°C. After letting the year on the model go to about 2023, I decreased the human carbon emissions to 75%, and started to see a gradual decrease in temperatures. I then continued to decrease the human emissions to 50%, and the temperature decreased even further, averaging about -2°C. ",5
"I conducted numerous experiements. In the first one, I made the human emissions 200%. The temperature went up very quickly, as did water vapor and CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 in the ocean decreased. My next experiment was putting the human emissions to 100%. All the factors decreased from the trend, but still continued to climb. Then, I put the human emissions at 0%. The temperature drastically decreases, as did the amount of CO2 in the air and the amount of water vapor. The amount of CO2 in the ocean increased. ",4

This decrease of temperature would allow for the ocean to absorb excess greenhouse gases. Any slight change to the environment has and effect. It's the butterfly effect. ",5

Additionally, when there is less sea ice, there will be less albedo. This means that more sunlight will be absorbed rather than reflected. If the solar radiation/sunlight is absorbed, temperatures will increase. The graphs support my answer because they show the correlation between each of these aspects'(carbon dioxide, water vapor, clouds, and sea ice) and the global temperature through the increases and decreases.",5

"By reducing the human emissions by only 25%, the temperature was able to reduce below the 0 mark and stabilize there. This is caused by the CO2 levels reducing and therefore letting more heat escape. With even this small change the temperature reduces. When this temperature reduces, the water vapor also reduces because it condenses, meaning both greenhouse gasses reduce, allowing the temperature to drop. However, about 10 years later, the temperatures begin to rise again due to the CO2 accumulating. However, they stabilize, only now they are on average at about 1 or 2 degrees. When the emissions drastically increase to 200%, the temperatures rise sharply and the opposite when they are brought to 0%. This means that human emissions impact temperature, but the global warming can be slowed by even slightly reducing human emissions.",4

"The outcomes of the experiments ultimately all came to the conclusion that humans have a big impact on global temperature rising due to greenhouse gas emissions. We affect these emissions through the use of automobiles, producing goods in factories, and many more causes. As greenhouse gases increase in the atmosphere, the temperature is rising. With more carbon in the atmosphere, more water vapor is in the atmosphere as well due to the increase in evaporation. Also, ice and snow at the poles is rapidly melting due to the increase and is therefore not reflecting as much sunlight back into space, which only furthers the increase in temperature. So, overall human actions lead to a long chain of events that are causing the global temperature to increase.",4

The change in greenhouse gas emissions also determines if the temperature will rise in a positive feedback loop, or fall as in a negative feedback loop. So, overall human actions lead to a long chain of events that are causing the global temperature to increase.",4
In most of the experiments the global temperature rose because of the excess of carbon emissions and the increase of water vapor in the atmosphere.,3
