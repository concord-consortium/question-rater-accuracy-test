I don't even know what I'm talking about honestly.,1
Knowing that in order to keep a steady flow the well needs to be close also,2
A well will drain all the water to where the only water supply is ground water.,3
I do not think this answer is wrong but I also do not think that this answer is right because any well could work both ways ,1
The examples and the before readings.Wells that are closer have a greater chance of receiving more water than far away wells which don't recieve all anyways because of absorbtion.,3
The water will keep flowing and the pumps will push it into the pipes for the wells and itll keep doing that until the well is filled up ,3

"I am not sure what would happen if a drought occurs, and the groundwater is not accessible",1
"I am not sure what would happen if a drought occurs, and the groundwater is not accessible",1
"The well place far from the stream, does not have access to the groundwater",2
"The well place far from the stream, does not have access to the groundwater",2
"The pump placed far from the stream, does not have access to the groundwater when the water table is low",2
The experiments show the stream being maintained better when the wells was placed farther from the stream rather then closer. Meaning if the wells are placed correctly the water flow will become good over time,3
if you look at how the water flows when you have a well close to the stream you will see that the water doesn't over flow ,2
if you look at how the water flows when you have a well close to the stream you will see that the water doesn't over flow and the water doesn't just all go to the well also if you make it to where the wells don't take so much water you can control how much water is in the stream ,2
if the wells are around in the mid of far and close it would make it to where the water stays at a constant level and the wells has a good flow of water to them to ,3
be,0
being closer to the water allows you access to more water because your close to it and its all in one place.,2
i thing that  it is that the stream is getting bi,1
the diagram and the things i know about wells and streams and what flow ,2
I didn't wait long to get more data so I might be wrong.,1
