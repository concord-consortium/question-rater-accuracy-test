The non-flowback well in the urban area was only recharged by runoff that happened to find its way into the urban aquifer, due to the impermeable surface there.",5
If you run off water from a permeable area from a non permeable area there will be a steady water flow because the permeable area is easy to get a supply from because the water can store itself in the ground.,4

The water can recharge the aquifer and use a sustainable amount.,3
Rural has no water going in the wells because the rock is hard and the water isn't flowing through that and just sitting there and going into the wells. ,3
A flowback allows some of the water to flow back out of the well and around the area. In a rural area there is enough water for the withdrawls to be more or  equal to the inputs of water.,4

If the sediments are permeable for the water to seep through the ground then the water flowing out of the well can just sink back into the ground and remain charging.,5
After awhile the water amounts on both pumps started to decrease which means that the number of water it puts out is not the same as the water it takes in. Therefore the flowbacks and nonflow backs are better useful when put into the rural areas because there isnt anything to really stop the water flow.,4

the urban well would not produce this steady and frequent amount of flow because it would have to wait until the aquifer under the city was recharged. This would take a 1-2 on the other model for the well to be able to bring water up and even then there was not enough water in the aquifer to supply the city. ,3

As I can see the rural flow back well is sustainable water use because in the experiment we can see that one flow back well is constantly going straight. While non flow back wells were decreasing. They didnt get enough water in a long periods of time but the flow back well is getting more water in future. In the rural area the water can flow back to the aquifer so quickly and in the urban area the water is less permeability so the water can go into the groundwater. ,5

The water in well 1 is a flowback well while the other 2 are nonflow back. The flowback well in the rural area shows over the period of 5 years it contains the highest amount of water output meaning the water is able to continue. The nonflow back in the rural area is taking that water and going into the urban area which means more water going to the urban area is going to the waste just as the water in well 3 is. ,4
"The location of the well is important. In rural areas having a flowback is able to recharge the aquifer allowing it to use more amounts of water over a longer period of time. The graph shows over about 4 years the rural flowback is producing the most over time. Although the rural area has another well it is a nonflowback, which means it is not recharging the aquifer and not allowing the water to remain sustainable over time. The urban well is producing the least in a number of years proved by the graph because the water is sent to a wastewater treatment not letting the aquifer to recharge and bring the water back down to the surface.

rural well pumped to city ,1
"The Non-flowback well in the city takes more water and did eventually level out, but the overall refilling of the aquifer took longer to refill than the ones in the rural area even though both were sucking up water.",3
"The Non-flowback well in the city takes more water and did eventually level out, but the overall refilling of the aquifer took longer to refill than the ones in the rural area even though both were sucking up water. The rural aquifer took less time to refill due to the lack of a bedrock layer, this made the wells more effective than the urban well.",3

Sustainable water has to be equal to provide water to the urban area.,2
the only sustainable well is the one that gives flows back and only the rural aquifers flow back well satisfies that condition the rural well that was pumped to the cities slowly depleted the rural aquifer no flow backs and recharge of the aquifer from witch it came was allowed the urban area could not recharge its aquifer because the water was being pumped into a waste water plant even if the flow backs was allowed the surfaces are imper-able preventing recharge of the underlying aquifer  ,5
cause the water is flowing back into the underground aquifer ,3
the flowback well keep the water flowing back into the rural aquifer untill it over filled and then the water started to flow to the aquifer under the city ,3
this well allows the water to be able to flow back to the aquifer.,3
this well allows the water to be able to flow back to the aquifer. the well is what allows the water to be able to flow.,3
this well allows the water to be able to flow back to the aquifer. the well is what allows the water to be able to flow.,3
the urban area had more water in the ground for the well to collect and flowed through easily ,3
"The flow back well allows unused water to go back underground, and since there is no impermeable rock layers, rainwater can easily fall into the aquifer.",5
