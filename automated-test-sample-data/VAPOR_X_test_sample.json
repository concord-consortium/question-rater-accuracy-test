This means that less CO2 is absorbed by the ocean. The ocean is less affective in absorbing CO2 because as water vapor evaporates, the ocean cannot absorb as much CO2.","classification":"3"},{"text":"again if one raises up then the other one does the same thing.","classification":"3"},{"text":"According the the water vapor chart as I increased the temperature the water vapor also increased the same thing occurred when I decreased the temperature.","classification":"4"},{"text":"According to the graph, higher temperatures lead to higher amounts of atmospheric water vapor, thus proving that the temperature will increase respectively with the amount of water vapor.","classification":"4"},{"text":"A greenhouse gas is a gas that traps heat.

Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas the greater amount of water vapor in the air means higher temperatures.","classification":"5"},{"text":"According to the graph's presented above, as mentioned in the question water vapor is a greenhouse gas and as the water vapor increases the temperature will increase to allow for water vapor to form within the oceans on Earth.","classification":"6"},{"text":"According to the graph, as the temperature increased, the amount of water vapor increased. Since water vapor reflects infrared radiation back into the ground and ocean, and that in turn raises the temperature, then the more water vapor in the air, the higher the temperature rises.","classification":"6"}]
