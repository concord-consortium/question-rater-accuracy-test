This gave me only two possible answers; low porosity and low permeability, or high porosity and low permeability. From the previous question, I knew that it was possible for a highly porous material to be very hard for water to permeate, like with clay. However, the picture of the bedrock did not remind me of the obvious sedimentary appearance that clay gave me, so I decided to choose low porosity and low permeability. However, bedrock could just be a drier, more porcelain-like version of clay; making it have high porosity- but it is more likely that it is not.","classification":"4"},{"text":"I am certain about my response to my claim because I relate to the model and pictures and I also explain why I think that bedrock has a low porosity and permeability.
