It would keep a steady supply of water and give the growing stream a better chance of growing. The well closer to the stream manage top have a 600 water output, while the well further away started off good, but ran out of water. The closer well also gave the stream a faster growing rate. It was almost a straight shot to 1500 water level. The well further away help it go up but near the end it started to round off. This is why the location matters because it could potentially save you from running out of water.","classification":"4"},{"text":"A pump should be placed close to the stream because there is abundance of water in that area. Also if there is a high water table it would mean that water is flowing in to the stream and would create a steady flow of water. The flow in he stream would maintain the same because the well would bring water to the surface just like it would in a natural situation because the water flow is still going to the surface.","classification":"5"},{"text":"A pump should be placed close to the stream because there is abundance of water in that area.

When the well is closer to the stream it would accumulate more water since it is closer to the source rather than when it is farther from the source. As shown on the output graph the water achieved is higher in a shorter amount of time when the wells are closer to the stream.","classification":"5"},{"text":"Because closer to the stream is where the water flows so then that is where all the water is gonna flow to get to the stream so you would get more water. The diagram where the wells are closer to the stream is when the wells get a lot more water then when they are far away.","classification":"6"},{"text":"I think that wells should be closer to the stream because as water level drops as shown in the diagram the water runs more towards the center of the stream. If a well is farther away from the stream then when the water level goes down the well will no longer have a consistent flow of water. In the water level graph it shows that the well closer to the stream has a constant increase of the amount of water but the water level of the well farther away does not increase at all. The well near the stream is at the bottom of a slope so when water falls it runs down towards the well at the bottom of the slope. The well farther from the stream is at the top of the slope so the water runs away. If the stream is gaining then the water table will constantly recharge because the water moves into the stream not out of where the far well would be. In a gaining stream the water level moves up in the stream not farther away from the stream where the far away well will be. The well output of the well closer to the gaining stre","classification":"6"}]
