First, the model was run at the 2010 level of emissions for about five years to find what the global temperature was. The global temperature, as shown by the Temperature Change graph, remained around 0 degrees Celsius. When the amount of human emissions was decreased by 25%, interestingly enough, the temperature increased, as did the amount of water vapor. The water vapor decrease created more clouds, and the higher temperatures that it caused allowed more carbon dioxide to be absorbed by the ocean and more ice to melt. The clouds kept infrared radiation in longer, and less ice meant that more infrared radiation was being released from the ground because there was a higher chance of solar radiation being absorbed by it. Thus, the temperature would only increase more and more at this level. By decreasing the amount of emissions 25% more, so that emission levels were at 50% of what they were in 2010, a sli","classification":"6"},{"text":"According to the temperature change graph, the temperature started to go down to 3 degrees celsius from 5 degrees by 2030 with 0-25% emission and the greenhouse gas graph shows that carbon dioxide levels decreased f as well from 28 to 12 between 2026-2035. This is because greenhouse gasses trap heat in our atmosphere according to, What Is the Greenhouse Effect? article by LiveScience.com, so the less carbon dioxide we pump out, the less heat will get trapped.","classification":"6"}]
