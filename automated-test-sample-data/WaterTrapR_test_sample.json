In the diagram it seems there is constant precipitation so we would have to see the results in other weather conditions to evaluate this properly.","classification":"4"},{"text":"because that is how we get most of our water is by taking it from aquifers, lakes and rivers so it isn't always trapped in the ground","classification":"4"}]
