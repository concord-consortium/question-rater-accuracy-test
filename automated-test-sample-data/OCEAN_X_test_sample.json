This is because the carbon dioxide in the air traps particles in the air, therefore causing less carbon dioxide to be absorbed in the ocean because they are being blocked.","classification":"2"},{"text":"-less co2 is absorbed bc th eocean can only take in so much","classification":"3"},{"text":"A cording to my graph their is less CO2 being absorbed by the ocean then by the atmosphere. In the ocean the levels are between 0 and 5 in the atmosphere the levels are between 10 and 15.","classification":"3"},{"text":"According to the graph on CO2 concentration, as the atmosphere CO2 level goes up, the ocean CO2 goes down.","classification":"4"},{"text":"A higher temperature leads to a greater amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Another result of this is that less carbon dioxide is dissolved in the water. According to the graph, the higher the water temperature, the fewer gases can be dissolved in it.","classification":"4"},{"text":"As CO2 levels become higher, by default the temperature of atmosphere and ocean increases. With increasing ocean temperature, less CO2 can be absorbed by ocean.","classification":"5"},{"text":"As carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, there is an increase of temperature in the atmosphere because of the greenhouse gas effect. As a result of the rise in temperature, solubility of carbon dioxide in oceans or water decreases.","classification":"5"},{"text":"As atmospheric CO2 levels rise, it traps more and more heat, causing the global temperature to rise, a trend that can be seen in the top chart. However, as temperatures rise, it will warm up the ocean, causing the solubility of CO2 in water to decrease, as seen in the bottom graph, which causes a lower concentration of CO2 in the ocean.","classification":"6"},{"text":"A higher atmospheric temp suggests lower CO2 absorption levels in the ocean for two reasons. First, there is an inverse relationship between the amount of CO2 that is dissolved in the atmosphere as compared to the ocean. And secondly, A higher atmospheric","classification":"6"}]
