Higher temperature resulting from increased CO2 will in turn produce more water vapor, raising the temperature even higher. However, the only uncertainty is cloud formation and coverage. Without knowing how clouds form and how much/high, etc, it is impossible to know for sure whether the temperature will increase. It may be possible that an increase in water vapor leads to increased cloud coverage.",
