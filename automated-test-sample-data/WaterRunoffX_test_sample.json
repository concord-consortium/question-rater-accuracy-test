Which this is why a lot of the streams flood.","classification":"4"},{"text":"An aquifer under an urban area can recharge by rainfall because urban areas generally will have a park or some other area that is permeable where water can soak in. Though it may not be a lot some water would be getting in.","classification":"5"},{"text":"an aquifer can not be recharged by rainfall because off the impermeable soil the aquifer would have to be recharged not something other than rainfall because of the impermeable the ground the rain water cannot get into the aquifer to recharge it.","classification":"5"},{"text":"An aquifer beneath an urban area would be surrounded by non-permeable material. Non-permeable material inhibits recharge compared to permeable soil.
