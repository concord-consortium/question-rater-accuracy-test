[{"text":"?","classification":"0"},{"text":"because I know its rite","classification":"0"},{"text":"According the the information I was given it is a fact that water the more water vapor in the air the hotter it is.","classification":"1"},{"text":"According to the graph and model as the amount of water vapor increase nothing will happen to the temperature.","classification":"1"},{"text":"'the graph shows the atmosphere changing when the temperature rises if the temperature went down then the infrared radiation will be released into the air","classification":"2"},{"text":"According to the graph when the water vapor increases so does the temperature so therefore my answer is correct","classification":"2"},{"text":"According the the diagrams and previous knowledge, we know and can see that higher temperatures cause higher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere.","classification":"3"},{"text":"According to physics for future president all greenhouse gas traps heat by absorbing the infrared radiation and redirecting back to the earth as heat. Plus the model showed that as water vapor increased so did the temperature.","classification":"3"},{"text":"Although the graph only shows that temperature rises with water vapor, it is uncertain which one is causing which. The higher temperatures can be the one causing the rise in water vapor. Also, water vapor in the atmosphere causes clouds to form, which are effective in blocking out the sun's rays and infrared radiation, which can cool down the Earth.","classification":"4"},{"text":"I am almost absolutely certain with my claim based on my explanation. My claim matches the information that is shown by the model and graphs, and agrees with the facts that water vapor is a greenhouse gas and the information I already know about greenhouse gases. I cannot fully trust the model, as it is, after all, simply a model, but I still can be confident in my claim based on the other information I used to support and add on to my ideas.","classification":"4"}]
