Because the water vapor holds in the moisture and heat, it heats up the environment around it, that being the ocean and the air.","classification":"5"},{"text":"According to the graph, the temperature rises in unison with the atmospheric carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide reflects infrared heat back at the earth, heating it up.","classification":"5"},{"text":"According to the model, the temperature rises when the atmospheric CO2 level increases. The rising temperature in turn causes water vapor to increases in the atmosphere. Because water vapor and CO2 are both greenhouse gases, the temperature increases even more. This is backed up by Muller's explanation on water vapor. Since water vapor is formed through heat, it is likely there will be increased water vapor. As both are greenhouse gases, the temperature will rise.","classification":"6"},{"text":"A greenhouse gas is a gas that traps heat. Since CO2 is a greenhouse gas the temperature started to increase as more CO2 was emitted into the air. This happened because the more CO2 in the atmosphere the more heat that is being trapped and the higher the","classification":"6"}]
