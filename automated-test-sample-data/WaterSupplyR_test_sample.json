This is because in the graph it shows that the two leveled each other meaning the input and output were equivalent.","classification":"2"},{"text":"a flowback well allows water to flow back into the well. this would mean that it is the most sustainable because the water can be reused. the non-flowback well does not let the water flow back into the well so that decreases the amount of water.","classification":"3"},{"text":"A ground-water system consists of a mass of water flowing through the pores or cracks below the Earth's surface. This mass of water is in motion. Water is constantly added to the system by recharge from precipitation, and water is constantly leaving the system as discharge to surface water and as evapotranspiration. Each ground-water system is unique in that the source and amount of water flowing through the system is dependent upon external factors such as rate of precipitation, location of streams and other surface-water bodies, and rate of evapotranspiration.","classification":"3"},{"text":"3 because in the rural areas the population isnt high and we dont use a lot of water but in urban areas","classification":"4"},{"text":"3 because in the rural areas the population isnt high and we dont use a lot of water but in urban areas there is a larger population so there is more water being used.","classification":"4"}]
