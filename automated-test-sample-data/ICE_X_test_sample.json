[{"text":"i dont know","classification":"0"},{"text":"I am confident.","classification":"0"},{"text":"According to the graph as time goes on temperature decrease which means the ice melts at a quicker rate. In this model it shows the downward trend of temperature and ice so as long as this continues there will be less ice in 2100.","classification":"1"},{"text":"according to the graph the temperature decreases slowly, therefor it will continue to do that","classification":"1"},{"text":"because as time comes the more the temperature will increase.","classification":"2"},{"text":"because as the years go on the higher temperatures are getting","classification":"2"},{"text":"According to the graph, the yearly ice coverage has been increasing since 1978 and is still currently decreasing, if it continues to decrease, by the time it gets to 2010 it will have decreased more.","classification":"3"},{"text":"According to the graph, the yearly ice coverage has been increasing since 1978 and is still currently decreasing, if it continues to decrease, by the time it gets to 2010 it will have decreased more.

The graph shows a decrease in ice coverage which will lead to higher temperatures.","classification":"4"},{"text":"A decrease in ice will lead to an increase in temperature.","classification":"4"},{"text":"As I mentioned before, the ice being gone would decrease temperature because energy would be absorbed by the ocean and there would be less to reflect the energy.","classification":"5"},{"text":"As ice melts, the albedo decreases and more heat is absorbed by the earth. With less ice, the sea surface increases. This surface is dark so it absorbs heat. Because no of this, the temperature will increase.","classification":"5"},{"text":"According to the graph, Earth's temperature in the year 2100 would increase since the graph shows a trend a decreasing ice and the sun's rays reflect off ice.","classification":"6"},{"text":"According to the data the ice is going down so I think the temperature will keep on going down. The ice cools down earths surface and will also be reflecting solar radiation","classification":"6"}]
