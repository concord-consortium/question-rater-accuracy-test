There could be many other factors to decreasing sea ice such as the lack of clouds. This puts holes in my argument, because the answer could be B or C. Another such limitation is that this model is not up to date. It was last done in the year 2010 and the sea ice probably decreased from that time. The amount of sea ice in the 1970s is also probably not accurate, due to the fact that scientists had less advanced tools.","classification":"4"}]
