It is positive that the rock is porous, but it can be difficult to find the permeability in this case and its unknown whether it would sink","classification":"1"},{"text":"Based on other questions and also the picture it helped me answer my question fluently which makes me confident in my answe","classification":"2"},{"text":"Based on the photographs I am given, I can see clearly that pumice is very porous and permeable.","classification":"2"},{"text":"According to the picture pumice has a high porosity and low permeability. I am very certain because the rock floats with holes in it which means that the holes are not connected and the permeability is low.","classification":"3"},{"text":"According to the pictures above, they show that pumice has a many holes.","classification":"3"},{"text":"Almost all materials are permeable. For example, water can pass through dense materials such as clay. what also makes the rock flot? would it flout under any conditions? or just in a steady water flow.","classification":"4"},{"text":"I am almost mostly certain with my answer because i have all the evidence that it could be correct but there is always a possibility that it isn't quite right. The rock could still sink because maybe the water is not exiting or is just at a very slow pace","classification":"4"}]
