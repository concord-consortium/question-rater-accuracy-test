This mass of water is in motion. Water is constantly added to the system by recharge from precipitation, and water is constantly leaving the system as discharge to surface water and as evapotranspiration.","classification":"3"},{"text":"1 and 2 had a higher water withdraw while the 3rd had a lower withdraw.","classification":"3"},{"text":"A flowback allows some of the water to flow back out of the well and around the area. In a rural area there is enough water for the withdrawls to be more or equal to the inputs of water.","classification":"4"},{"text":"A rural flow back well allows for precipitation to recharge the well and for the water from the well to flow back to the aquifer.","classification":"4"},{"text":"Anything involving urban things won't show sustainable water use. Therefore, the only choice there is, is the rural flowback well and rural well pumped into the city. This doesn't involve urban wells. Rural flowback wells are better because they have more permeability, which enables a faster recharge.","classification":"5"},{"text":"As said on the instructions the water use for urban wells is good because it is not wasted which makes the last part of my choice good. Also since the Urban water is not enough to sustain the high population which means that the rural well is needed to provide the water for the city. Also since the urban aquifer is not as permeable meaning that the well will not recharge as fast as and would not provide for the urban population but could still be used for less consuming things. The rural well however would provide more water since its aquifer has more water.","classification":"5"},{"text":"According to the graph and the model, the rural flowback well gives more water than the rural well that pumps water back to the city. It is a more sustainable water source because it gives more than any of the others wells. The aquifers where the rural flowback well is located are very permeable, allowing water to flow through it. Whereas the aquifers in the urban area is impermeable, not allowing water to flow through it. The rural wells in general are better at giving a sustainable water source because they are able to recharge themselves, while the urban area aquifers have to be filled up from the rural area water overflow.","classification":"6"},{"text":"A flowback well allows for water to flow back from where it was taken, and it works because the sediment/rock was permeable. The model shows that even though there was a non-flowback well, the flowback well levels it out.","classification":"6"}]
