It can't be evaporated from the ground or boiled cause you can't boil the ground!","classification":"3"},{"text":"According to the diagram, the water evaporates from the ground to the surface since there is a hole or a gap that is exposed to the air.","classification":"4"},{"text":"According to the animation, the water droplets would fall through each layer (each layer representing a different type of sediment I assume) and just make its way all the way down to the bottom and it would just sit there.","classification":"4"},{"text":"after going into ground it is hard to get it back would have to pay a big digger to dig it up after it goes in to the ground","classification":"5"},{"text":"After it is absorbed, it will evaporate for the water cycle to continue.","classification":"5"},{"text":"According to my observations of the water droplet demo, the raindrops soak through the ground layers and keep on going. Even if it looks like the raindrops are stopped by a layer, they are just moving through that layer at a slower pace.","classification":"6"},{"text":"According to the follow the water droplet demonstration, every droplet that was absorbed by the ground stayed down there. It isn't, however, trapped permanently. The water would not likely evaporate out due to the water vapor being unable to escape throug","classification":"6"}]
