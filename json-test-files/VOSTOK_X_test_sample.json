The higher the ppm around that time, the higher the temperatures. Therefore, the temperature of 125,000 would be higher than 355,000 because 125,000 has a higher CO2 concentration in the ice.","classification":"4"},{"text":"125,000 years ago appears to be around 270 bpm, but 355,000 appears to be around 187 bpm.","classification":"4"},{"text":"Because of the amount of co2 in the atmosphere, the temperature would have risen, because carbon is a greenhouse gas that keeps heat from escaping.","classification":"5"},{"text":"Because of the amount of co2 in the atmosphere, the temperature would have risen, because carbon is a greenhouse gas that keeps heat from escaping. When carbon goes up, the heat is trapped, and therefore the temperature rises too.","classification":"5"},{"text":"125,000 years ago, the level of carbon dioxide was 280 ppm, which was much higher than the level of carbon dioxide 355,000 years ago, which was only 180 ppm. We use carbon dioxide levels to compare temperatures because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and causes the Earth's temperature to increase. This is because greenhouse gases act as insulators, trapping the sun's heat as well as IR heat from the Earth itself.","classification":"6"},{"text":"125K years ago showed a very high ppm of CO2, while 355K years ago showed the lowest ppm. Since CO2 reflects IR heat back to the earth, more CO2 125K years ago would mean the temperature would have been higher than 355K years ago.","classification":"6"}]
