Co2 is a greenhouse gas and greenhouse gases trap heat so without it there is nothing to trap heat with.","classification":"5"},{"text":"A co2 rises temperature rises, as co2 decreases temperature increases because co2 traps heat in the atmosphere.","classification":"5"},{"text":"According to the temperature graph, when all the carbon dioxide is removed, the average decreases. With a value of 15 CO2 in the atmosphere, the average temperature was around 1-2 degrees Celsius. After removing all the carbon dioxide, the average temperature dropped slightly below 0 degrees Celsius. This decreases because there is no longer any carbon dioxide to trap/reflect the infrared radiation.","classification":"6"},{"text":"As seen in the model, the carbon dioxide molecules in the air reflect infrared heat rays back into the earth. This allows the infrared rays to heat the earth's surface temperature up, as packets enter the surface.","classification":"6"}]
