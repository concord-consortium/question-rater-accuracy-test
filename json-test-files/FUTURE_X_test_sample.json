With the atmosphere growing thinner and more sunlight being let in, it's melting some of the stuff that helps","classification":"3"},{"text":"A because of global warming, in the next 90 years it will increase the temperature.

Its unlikely that this factor will change, so the trend should stay rising.","classification":"6"},{"text":"1)Human behavior/releasing a lot of carbon 2) Population 3) Using a lot of energy/fossil fuels 4)Graph shows temp is increasing","classification":"6"}]
