Some sediments and rocks are very permeable (allow water to flow through quickly), and others are less permeable, allowing virtually no water to pass through. Looking at the picture, I can tell that there aren't a lot of holes and that it has high permeability from the previous information given in the other questions. Also, generally when a rock has low porosity it usually has high permeability.","classification":"3"},{"text":"According to the previous information given, Some sediments and rocks are very porous (have lots of spaces for water), and others have very little space for water (non-porous).

On the left model the photo depicts the pumice rock's connected holes and how water can move. On the right model the pumice floats because of the smaller density from the holes. On the ground pumice would be the top layer because of the easy access for water to seep down below.","classification":"4"},{"text":"a lot oh holes, but water doesn't seem to be going through it.","classification":"4"},{"text":"a rock with high porosity has a lot of air space.If a rock has low porosity, it does not have much air space.

Porosity can be a factor in permeability.","classification":"5"},{"text":"According to the first picture of this rock it is shown that the rock has many spaced out unconnected holes (high porosity) but the only way it can float is if water is difficult to get through (low permeability) allowing the rock to float in the water as shown in the second picture.","classification":"6"},{"text":"A pumice should have low permeability and high porosity. This is because a pumice bar has many holes but the water does come out, therefore making it have a high porosity. It has a low permeability because the pumice does not have a easy water flow.","classification":"6"}]
