[{"text":"...","classification":"0"},{"text":"(come back)","classification":"0"},{"text":"as you go down in layers of sediment the permeability and porosity seems to get lesser so bedrock would be very low","classification":"1"},{"text":"According to the picture the rocks have a high porosity and high permeability of bedrock because there are many holes and water can easily flow through.","classification":"1"},{"text":"Bedrock has low porosity and low permeability because it is hard rock found at the very bottom and is almost to the Earth's core.","classification":"2"},{"text":"according to the modeled pictures the claim I am making is that the porosity and permeability is of bed rock.","classification":"2"},{"text":"because high porosity an high permeability means that the water can easily flow through it, has pave to let air or water to go thorough it.","classification":"3"},{"text":"according to the modeled pictures the claim I am making is that the porosity and permeability is of bed rock. My claim is Bedrock If you dig deep enough into the ground, you will eventually hit bedrock. The first picture (Picture A) shows a close-up view","classification":"3"},{"text":"according to picture b it don't have no space for holes or for water to get through","classification":"4"},{"text":"According to picture A, The bed rock looks to no have many holes at all. Therefore no porosity. The bed rock also looks like it is all solid not being able to absorb things so therefore there is no permeability.","classification":"4"},{"text":"According to the pictures, especially the close up, it shows how solid the bedrock is. It has no holes which most likely means that water cannot easily seep through it. Plus its the last layer","classification":"5"},{"text":"because bed rock is not porous therefore it is not permeable","classification":"5"},{"text":"According to the graph, water doesn't seem to be flowing through it that much. According to the pic of bedrock it has very low porosity so the lower the porosity the lower the permeability.","classification":"6"},{"text":"according to past diagrams, bedrock was the layer that would not let water seep through it. This is because bedrock does not have many holes nor does water flow easily through it.","classification":"6"}]
