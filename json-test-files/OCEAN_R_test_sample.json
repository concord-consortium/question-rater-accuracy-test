For example, I know that the amount of carbon dioxide and the temperature are correlated, but I did not know that the temperature of water determined it's absorbtion.","classification":"1"},{"text":"According to the diagram,","classification":"2"},{"text":"According to the graph, even though the level increases and decreases, at certain points it will stay at a constant rate for a certain amount of time. I feel like I did not watch the graph for a long enough amount of time to truly get a good feel for how the information works with the graph, but I still feel very sure of myself and my answers.","classification":"2"},{"text":"According to the changing ocean temperature model when you turn up the temperature more carbon dioxide is in the ocean, but less of the gas gets dissolved","classification":"3"},{"text":"According to the graph, the carbon dioxide levels and the temperature are related, if the carbon dioxide levels are high, then the temperature was most likely high. Since the carbon levels 355,00 years ago is lower than 125,000 years ago, the temperature in 125,000 years ago was higher.","classification":"3"},{"text":"Because when we actually added heat to the model, the graphs showed us that when CO2 in the atmosphere is high, CO2 in the ocean is low. The graphs are tough to read and evaluate because the temperature rises and falls much more drastically than the CO2.","classification":"4"},{"text":"I am at a 4 for certainty because we have been studying the relationship between carbon dioxide, air temperature, and the ocean this entire module. If the ocean is absorbing less carbon dioxide, it goes back into the air causing a rise in temperature and carbon dioxide concentration. The model also shows the relationship in the graphs, you see a rise in atmospheric temperature and a decline in absorption in the ocean. This helps to prove my initial claim that as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels become higher, less carbon dioxide is being absorbed by the ocean. My claim may be wrong however because the graphs and model itself do not take into consideration all of the elements in the real world. I feel confident in my answer nonetheless. The graphs support all that I was asked and have answered. The strength for my response lies in the graph.","classification":"4"}]
