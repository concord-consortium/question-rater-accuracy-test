VAPOR_X,When the temperature decreases the less water vapor there is in the air so if the amount of water vapor rises there should be an increase in temperature.,3,4
VAPOR_X,Water vapor has the same effect as CO2 it warms up the atmosphere too.,4,3
VAPOR_X,the temperature affects the water vapor. The water vapor doesn't affect the temperature because it is the effect of the temperature.,2,3
VAPOR_X,"Id say the higher the temperature, the more water vapor will occur.",3,4
VAPOR_X,The more water vapor in the air then the hotter the air will get due to evaporation.,3,3
VAPOR_X,I know the temperature will stay the same from the graph it shows that only carbon dioxide makes the temperature decrease. It is staying the same the ocean temperature and the water vapor lines are the exact same on the graph. ,2,3
VAPOR_X,"Temperatures would increase because, greenhouse gases like water vapor trap heat in the atmosphere. With the water vapor retaining the heat the temperatures are going to increase.",5,5
VAPOR_X,As the Temperature increase that will make the sun hot and allow it to shine down on the water causing the water to reach its certain boiling point for allowing it to take in as much temperature as it can and then it will turn into a air form and continue to rise up into the atmosphere.  ,3,3
VAPOR_X,"because when the temp rises water vapor rises, so it counter acts each other ",3,4

VAPOR_X,"On the line graphs, the temperature of the air decreases whenever the water vapor decreases. ",2,3
VAPOR_X,"On the line graphs, the temperature of the air decreases whenever the water vapor decreases. The type of line for both graphs is nearly the same. ",2,3
VAPOR_X,"On the line graphs, the temperature of the air decreases whenever the water vapor decreases. The type of line for both graphs is nearly the same. The energy packets flow through and with the greenhouse gases. ",3,3

VAPOR_X,"Since the temperature has an effect on the water vapor maybe the water vapor has an effect of temperature. When the temperature increase so does the water vapor, so maybe if the water vapor was to increase so would the temperature.",3,4

When the temperature increase so does the water vapor, so maybe if the water vapor was to increase so would the temperature. If i increase the temperature it shows in the graph that the temperature increases but when it does it also increases the water vapor.",4,4
