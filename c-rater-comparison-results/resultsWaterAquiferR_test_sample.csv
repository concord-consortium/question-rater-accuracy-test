WaterAquiferR,The Graph explains it all. Eventually with the unconfined source we would run of of water. I am sure about this because its common sense. If it was the other way around we would run out of water to drink.,2,1
WaterAquiferR,"on the graph that was shown, the confined aquifer did not supply water for very long because it never got more added. when you used all it had that was it. the unconfined aquifer  was getting more water added to its supply every time it rained.",3,3
WaterAquiferR,"on the graph that was shown, the confined aquifer did not supply water for very long because it never got more added. when you used all it had that was it. the unconfined aquifer  was getting more water added to its supply every time it rained. the graph only goes up to 10 years which is its weakness, it does not show what happens beyond those 10 years.",3,3
WaterAquiferR,i read the decription at the top of the page tha said what they was,2,1

WaterAquiferR,i chose a certainty rating of four due to the model being acuret  but it may contain some errors  ,1,1

WaterAquiferR,I chose a certainty rating of four because the model gives me a good idea of how unconfined aquifer are very sustainable. this is why i think it is a certainty rating of four,2,2
WaterAquiferR,I chose a certainty rating of four because the model gives me a good idea of how unconfined aquifer are very sustainable.  the certainty rating is four due to the model showing you what happens to unconfined and confined aquifers,2,2
WaterAquiferR,i am very certain that unconfined water sources are sustainable water sources because confined water sources has limited amounts of water because rain water cant get to it.,2,3
WaterAquiferR,confined means no extra water flow is alowed but unconfined means that extra water can flow into it to provide a more sustaniable water source.,2,1
WaterAquiferR,I'm certain that the water is confined. ,1,1
WaterAquiferR,I'm certain that the water is unconfined. It may not have a impermeable top layer. But  these aquifers may be open to underground or surface.,2,3
WaterAquiferR,I'm certain that the water is unconfined. It may not have a impermeable top layer. But  these aquifers may be open to underground or surface. Precipitation can recharge (or refill) the unconfined aquifers.,3,3

WaterAquiferR,Everything I said is based on factual evidence.,1,2
WaterAquiferR,I used evidence given by the model along with knowledge I gained from previous activities. Water from a rainstorm cannot reach the lower confined layers due to the impermeable layer above the confined layer.,3,3

WaterAquiferR,The model was evidence that ,2,2
WaterAquiferR,confined aquifers can not be recharged because of the impermeable surface on top cause rain to not come through and there to be a low supply of water unlike a unconfined aquifer that can be recharged because it dose not have a impermeable surface blocking water from coming through leaving a steady supply of water because it is rechargeble ,3,3
WaterAquiferR,it is proven in the example ,2,2
WaterAquiferR,i am very certain cause the example shows the water is not able to make it to the confined aquifer ,2,3
WaterAquiferR,i am very certain cause the example shows the water is not able to make it to the confined aquifer so the unconfined aquifer is the best chose of the wells to go to because the rain can fill that aquifer unlike the confined one ,4,3
