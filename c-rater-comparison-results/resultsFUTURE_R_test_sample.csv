FUTURE_R,I put a certainty rating of 5 because i read the graph and seen the data and predicted thats the average tempature increase that we will see in the next 90 years.,3,2
FUTURE_R,unless something crazy happens the world will continuse to get hotter ,2,1
FUTURE_R,The graph influenced my certainty rating.,2,2

FUTURE_R,At no point does the temperature just drop and continue to go down.,2,3
FUTURE_R,At no point does the temperature just drop and continue to go down. The graph shows a steady increase in temperature.,3,3
FUTURE_R,i'm not fully certain but i'm not completely not having a clue either . honestly i think we may get a little bit hotter and the temp might go up but every year the temps almost the same amount every season.,2,1
FUTURE_R,You never know what happens the weather could just randomly chnage after a while.,1,1
FUTURE_R,You never know what happens the weather could just randomly change after a while.,1,1
FUTURE_R,the graph above. it hasn't decreased and has been steadily increasing.,3,3
FUTURE_R,In the past the temperature increased and the B and C line showed the temperature decreasing and looking at the graph it showes it should continue to increase. ,3,3
FUTURE_R,the graph shows that the temp is going do,2,3

FUTURE_R,I'm certain that in the future Line B's temperature will stay the same. while A will increase it's temperature and C will decrease it's temperature. It stays the same because the line started in 1880 and kept going in line B.,2,2
FUTURE_R,I'm certain that this will help us predict in the future because Line B states it will stay the same.,2,2

FUTURE_R,I looked at the graph and thought of what the likeliest scenario would be. I determined that it would be the steady increasing of global average temperature. I am somewhat certain in my answer.,2,3
