The rays then begin to bounce into the sky in the model when there is no c02.,3,3
CARBON_R,The heat starts to disappear every time you get rid of co2. I noticed when there was a lot c02 the infrared energy solar packets would bounce back off once it hits the c02 and wouldn't be able to escape back up into the atmosphere like it'd be able to do when there is no c02. ,3,3

CARBON_R,The graph gives me all the evidence I need to produce an educated answer.,2,2
CARBON_R,The graph gives me all the evidence I need to produce an educated answer for example the graph shows me the rise of the temperature in the atmosphere and shows me the level of CO2 concentration.,2,2
CARBON_R,I am very certain because the line goes down when you hit the button to remove the CO2 the line will drastically go down.,3,2
CARBON_R,there is more than one gas in the atmosphere. we want to know ,1,1
