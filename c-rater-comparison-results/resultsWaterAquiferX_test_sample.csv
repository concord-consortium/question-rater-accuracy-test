WaterAquiferX,Unconfined aquifer could potentially provide a sustainable source of water because in the model a confined aquifer provided some water but then the well stopped pumping water. In the model it shows how an unconfined aquifer keeps providing more and more water and the well keeps pumping water which means an unconfined aquifer will produce more water. Also a confined aquifer will barely have any water because no water will be able to get to it but an unconfined aquifer will keep producing water because it is not trapped. ,4,4
