OCEAN_X,"When there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, temperatures become higher because of the greenhouse effect. When the temperatures rise, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in the ocean. As shown in the diagram, when put on a higher temperature, less hexagons, representing carbon, can be dissolved. When put on a lower temperature, more hexagons can be dissolved. Therefore, the higher the temperature the less carbon can be dissolved and the lower the temperature the more carbon can be dissolved.",4,6
OCEAN_X,"When the atmospheric carbon dioxide is increased, the temperature is also at an increase. A smaller amount of carbon dioxide can be dissolved in the water if the temperature is high. That means that if the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are high, the carbon dioxide levels will be high too.",4,4
OCEAN_X,less Co2 will b absorbed if there is more Co2 in the atmosphere. this is because more Co2 in the atmosphere will mean more heat trapped in the atmosphere and an increased temperature. a higher temperature mean less dissolved Co2 as shown in the module and graph,5,4
OCEAN_X,The more carbon dioxide in the air warmer the temperature which lowers the solubility.,4,3
OCEAN_X,The more carbon dioxide in the air warmer the temperature which lowers the solubility.,4,3
OCEAN_X,Between the the atmosphere and the ocean they would have to equally exchange the amount of carbon dioxide so if one had more than the other that would mean one would have to take less then before and the other way around.,3,3

OCEAN_X,the co2 on the earth temperature less co2 is absorbed by the ocean,4,4
OCEAN_X,if the ocean is getting less co2 from the water that means it is evaporating so there for the atmosphere has more co2. which is what the graph shows.,4,4
OCEAN_X,That's due to the Carbon Dioxide not being able to dissolve faster than the ocean can gather it. ,3,4
OCEAN_X,the graph showed the ocean absorb more ,1,1
