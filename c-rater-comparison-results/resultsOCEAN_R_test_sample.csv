OCEAN_R,"carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, increased heat leads to lower solubility of carbon dioxide in the ocean, lower solubility in the ocean leads to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ( less carbon dioxide means it has to go somewhere, and that somewhere means the air) and more carbon dioxide in the air leads to further warming.

OCEAN_R,"I used the model to show that when atmospheric carbon dioxide increases, carbon dioxide in the ocean decreases

also increasing temperature has a positive effect on atmospheric concentrations and a negative effect on ocean concentration of carbon dioxide

increasing ocean temperature results in decreasing solubility of carbon dioxide in the ocean. therefore the ocean absorbs less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere",2,3

OCEAN_R,"The points that influenced my certainty rating are that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and greenhouse gases trap heat in the earths atmosphere, having increased heat leads to a lower solubility of CO2 in the ocean.
