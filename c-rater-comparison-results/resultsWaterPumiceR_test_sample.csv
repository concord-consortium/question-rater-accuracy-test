WaterPumiceR,"looking at the image of the rock above, i observed the holes and used what i know to answer these questions.",3,2
WaterPumiceR,"looking at the image of the rock above, i observed the holes and used what i know to answer these questions. these images will show you that the water can start to flow because the holes in the rock allows the water to seep threw.",3,2

WaterPumiceR,i am not sure that is it because ,0,0
WaterPumiceR,the picture it shows and it has many connected holes which will be easy for the water to move through ,3,3
WaterPumiceR,My ,0,0
WaterPumiceR,"My knowledge on pumice, how it's formed, and how porous and permeable it is influenced my rating. I know for a fact that pumice is porous and permeable.",2,1
