If the graph demonstrating ice extent continues to decrease, there will be very little ice left in the year 2100. Since ice is a white surface, sunlight reflects off of it and is sent back into space. More ice means more albedo, or more light reflecting back into space. Less ice means lower albedo and increasing temperatures because the more light reflected back into space decreases temperatures. But if less ice is available for light to reflect back into space, more light will be on Earth's surface, increasing temperatures.",6,6
ICE_X,"As ice reduces less light is reflected, meaning there is a lower albedo. This is seen by the fact that the ice reduced from 10.5 to 8.25 million square kilometers. With less ice reflecting light, the temperature will increase, causing a positive  feedback loop and a steady increase in temperature.",6,6

ICE_X,"Ice causes the color of the sea surface to change. With more ice, the sea surface is lighter and reflects more radiation, decreasing Earth's  temperature. With less ice, the sea surface is darker, absorbing more radiation and increasing Earth's temperature.The more Earth's temperature increases, the more ice melts, and the more the sea surface darkens. This is shown in the graph as the sea ice extent decreases over time because of the rising temperature.",6,6
ICE_X,"If ice is continually decreasing over the next 100 years, less sunlight can be reflected. This is because ice is one of the most reflective surfaces, and without ice more heat could be absorbed. This raises the global temperature.",6,6
ICE_X,"As the ice continues to melt, the color of the surface of the sea changes. With more ice, the color is lighter and there is a higher albedo, so more solar radiation is reflected. As the sea ice melts, the sea surface becomes darker and appears. The sea surface can absorb more solar radiation. The more solar radiation that is absorbed, the more heat, leading to more ice melting.

ICE_X,"it will increase earths temperature because as the ice continues to melt, the color of the sea surface changes. with more cie, the color is lighter and more solar radiation is being reflected. But when the ice melts, the sea surface appears darker in color. The sea surface can also absorb more radiation. the more radiation absorbed, the more heat in the water. with more heat, the more the ice melts. the more ice that melts means there is more solar radiation that can be absorbed in which will lead to an increasing hea.",6,6
ICE_X,"The trend shown in the graph affect Earth's temperature, in year 2100, by causing the temperature of Earth to increase. As the ice continues to melt the color of the sea begins to change its color. The amount of ice begins to decrease and makes the color of the water lighter, which means that it has a higher albedo. As the ice melts, it has a lower albedo. Since it has a lower albedo, the ice can absorb more of the solar radiation, which means that it will melt more quickly and add more heat to the atmosphere increasing the temperature. ",5,6
ICE_X,"Ice has a high albedo and reflects a considerable amount of sunlight. If there is less ice, less sunlight would be reflected. Instead, the sunlight would be absorbed by the dark-colored ocean, warming the Earth.",6,6

That would make the land darker and more energy would be absorbed into the ground which would make the Earth hotter.",6,6

ICE_X,Based on the graph and the knowledge that with less snow comes higher temperatures I am certain that earths tmperature will continue to climb.,2,3
ICE_X,"The trend in the graph may affect earths temperatures by causing more heat to be abosorbed making more snow to melt, then more heat to be aborsed again and again.",3,3

ICE_X,It will increase earths temperature because their will be less ice to reflect the suns infrared radiation.,6,6
ICE_X,"If the trend that is showing in the graph continues, tnat means that there is less and less ice coverage of the Earth. If there is less ice coverage on the Earth, there isn't as much albedo on the Earth, meaning that the Earth will absorb more and more of sun's coverage.",5,6
ICE_X,The temperature varies with the seasons throughout the year but over many years the temperature of the earth increases because the ice extent doesn't reach the freezing point as often so the ice doesnt extent as far. It goes from 10.7 km to 8.7 km.,4,4
