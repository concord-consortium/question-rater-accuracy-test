FUTURE_X,there is no reason for it to slow down it has been increasing for a while so why would it change,4,2
FUTURE_X,"I don't believe that it will drastically increase, but rather just slowly increase, because under the current presidential administration, CO2 levels in the air have been the lowest in 50 years and the ozone has also recovered more right now than any past time, so with the less CO2 in the air, the weaker our greenhouse effect will be, thus not making the temp. rise drastically.",5,6
