impermeable. Water that would otherwise infiltrate into the ground is forced to run off into

WaterRunoffR,"Based o previous examples in these questions, aquifers are better charged when they are surrounded by permeable rocks, and have a harder time being recharged when surrounded by impermeable rocks.
