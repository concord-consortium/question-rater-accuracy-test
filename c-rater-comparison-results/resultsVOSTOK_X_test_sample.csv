VOSTOK_X,"The Keeling curve only shows carbon dioxide levels for the past 50 years or so. The Earth has had an atmosphere for over 4 billion (4,000,000,000) years. 
It is not until recently that humans have been able to measure carbon dioxide levels. How can we know what carbon dioxide levels were in the more distant past?
Atmospheric gases are stored in the spaces between ice crystals in the snow and ice of glaciers and ice sheets. Scientists drill holes into the ice to extract ice cores. Older layers of ice are at the bottom, with younger layers on top.
When sections of the ice are melted in the lab, scientists can measure the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases that were trapped when the ice formed. The levels of trapped gas are measured in parts per million (ppm). A measurement of 350 ppm CO2 means that for every one million (1,000,000) gas molecules, 350 of them are carbon dioxide.",3,0

VOSTOK_X,The influence of my certainty rating is that if the temperature has been on a constant increase since the beginning of the graph there is no evidence to prove that it will slow down or start to decrease so the logical answer would be Line A. In the graph it shows that the increase of temperature is at a constant pace and Line A continues that pace so it would make sense if Line A is would be the possibility.,3,1
